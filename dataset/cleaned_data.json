In case Cardholder\u2019s credit limit is breached due to a higher amount presented by the merchant at the time of settlement, there will be no charges levied. *** Users to be eligible for 1% (Maximum Rs.100/-) Fuel Surcharge Waiver upon spend of minimum Rs.400/- and maximum spend of Rs.3,000/- exclusive of GST and other charges. **Withdrawal Limits** Your Credit Limit will be communicated to you at the time of card issuance. These limits will be mentioned in your monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which you can make purchases or withdraw cash from an ATM respectively. Cash limit is a subset of your credit limit i.e. up to 20% of your Credit Limit and is assigned based on your usage patterns, payment behavior and credit history. It will only be activated after 180 days from the date of issuance of the Edge+-CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card. After this 180 day period, your cash limit will be made available at the sole discretion and on such terms as may be communicated by CSB Bank from time-to-time. **Billing Statement** Your billing statement will be generated every month and sent to your registered email address (Refer to the MITC or Jupiter App for the exact dates based on your Billing cycle) It will contain a break-up of all fees, purchases, interest charges, repayments, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used during the billing cycle, the billing statement will mention there were no spends in that month. **Minimum Amount Due** When you receive your Edge+ CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card statement, you can choose to pay the total amount due or the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due \\+ EMI amount billed for the month \\+ 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes --- If the minimum amount due is less than Rs. 500, you\u2019ll be charged Rs. 500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than Rs. 500, then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. The Minimum Amount Due should be paid before the Payment Due Date. The remaining balance can be carried forward to subsequent months. Note, that paying the minimum amount due would still incur you finance charges on the unpaid bill amount. ### Method of payment You can pay the outstanding dues from the mobile app using the following modes: Auto-debit from your bank account Bank transfer from your bank account UPI payments (up to Rs. 2 lakh or any other such amounts prescribed from time to time) from any virtual payment account added to the Jupiter App. Via debit card and net banking through any bank account using a unique payment link sent to you via SMS and email CSB Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. Interest-Free (grace) period Interest-free period, from the start of the billing cycle date, shall be 13 - 47 days (depending on the date of the transaction). However, the interest-free period will not be available if you fail to pay the total amount due of the previous month. The payment due date for the Edge+-CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card comes at least 14 days after the Statement Generation Date (Please check your statement for your exact Payment Due Date). Therefore, the interest free credit period can range from 13 - 47 days depending on the date of your credit card transaction. **Illustrative Example for Interest-Free Period Calculation** For a statement for the period from May 1, 2025 to May 30, 2025 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2025.Assuming that you have paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: For a purchase dated May 2, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2025 to June 15, 2025, i.e. 45 days. For a purchase dated May 30, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2025 to June 15, 2025, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: 1\\. If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. 2\\. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. 3\\. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (\u201c**RBI** \u201d) post the payment due date during which if you make a repayment, it is considered a timely repayment. **Illustration of Interest Charges** 1\\. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. 2\\. Additionally, interest will be levied on all cash advances from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the TAD of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date | Details ---|--- 2 March, 2025 | Transaction of \u20b910,000 | 1 April, 2025 | Statement generated Total Amount Due: \u20b910,000 Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9 500 15 April, 2025 | Payment due Total Amount Due: \u20b910,000 Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9 500 | 21 April 2025 | Payment of \u20b92000 made 22 April, 2025 | Transaction of \u20b91000 On statement dated 1 May 2025 , the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 --- Details | Reason | Amount | Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 50 days (from Mar 2 to Apr 20)| Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9616.44 | (10000 x 50 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30)| Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of | \u20b998.63 | (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 | payment till the next statement date| | ---|---|---|--- | | | Interest on \u20b91,000 for 9 days (from Apr 22 to Apr 30)| Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b911.09 | (1000 x 9 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable | Sum of all the above charges| \u20b9726.16 | (\u20b9616.44+\u20b998.63+\u20b911.0 9) GST is applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9130.71 | 18% x \u20b9726.16 Total Payable (Interest + GST)| | \u20b9856.87 | \u20b9726.16 + \u20b9130.71 _Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged._ **Billing disputes resolution** In the event the Card Member disagrees with the charges indicated in the statement, it should be communicated to Bank by calling Customer Care on +91 86550 55086 within 30 days of receipt of the statement, failing which it would be construed that all charges indicated in the statement are accepted by you.

Illustrative example for calculation of Late Payment Fee: In the example below, consider the billing cycle is 1st of the calendar month - end of the month. Statements are generated on the 1st and are due on the 15th of every month. There is no principal outstanding at the start of the following cycle. Date | Details ---|--- 2 March, 2025 | Transaction of \u20b910,000 1 April, 2025 | Statement generated. \u25cf Principal Amount Due: \u20b910,000 \u25cf Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9500 15 April, 2025 | Payment due \u25cf Principal Amount Due: \u20b910,000 \u25cf Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9500 | ---|--- 21 April, 2025 | Payment of \u20b92,000 made 1 May, 2025 | Late payment fee of \u20b9500 applied 1 May, 2025 | GST of \u20b990 on the Late Payment Fee added to bill Interest Charges: 1\\. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201cTAD\u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the principal outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. 2\\. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the Total Amount Due (\u201cTAD\u201d) of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date | Details ---|--- 2 March, 2025 | Transaction of \u20b910,000 1 April, 2025 | Statement generated. \u25cf Principal Amount Due: \u20b910,000 \u25cf Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9500 15 April, 2025 | Payment due \u25cf Principal Amount Due: \u20b910,000 \u25cf Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9500 ---|--- | 21 April, 2025 | Payment of \u20b92,000 made 22 April, 2025 | Transaction of \u20b91,000 4\\. On statement dated 1 May 2025, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Principal Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 Details | Reason | Amount | Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 50 days (from Mar 2 to Apr 20)| Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9616.44 | (10000 x 50 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30)| Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date| \u20b998.63 | (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 | | | Interest on \u20b91,000 for 9 days (from Apr 22 to Apr 30)| Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b911.09 | (1000 x 9 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 ---|---|---|--- Total Interest Payable| Sum of all the above charges| \u20b9726.16 | (\u20b9616.44+\u20b998.63+\u20b911.09) GST is applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9130.71 | 18% x \u20b9726.16 Total Payable (Interest + GST)| | \u20b9856.87 | \u20b9726.16 + \u20b9130.71 Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged. **Cash Advance** Cardholders cannot use the Edge CSB Bank Credit Card and Edge+ CSB Bank CreditCard to withdraw cash from ATMs in India and/or overseas. Interest Free Period The interest free period could range from 13 to 47 days. Example for the calculation of interest free period: For a statement for the period from May 1, 2025to May 31, 2025 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2025. Assuming that the cardholder has paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: 1\\. For a purchase dated May 2, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2025 to June 15, 2025, i.e. 45 days. 2\\. For a purchase dated May 30, 2024, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2025 to June 15, 2025, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. There is an additional three-day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank India \u201cRBI\u201d) post the payment due date during which if the Cardholder makes a payment, they will not be charged late payment or interest charges. **Forex Markup Fee** If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled which may not be the same date on which the transaction was made. If the transaction is not in USD (US Dollars), the amount will first be converted to USD, and then the USD amount will be converted to INR as per the rate provided by international network partners of RuPay. On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied, and GST will be applicable on the markup fee. If this transaction is reversed, both the markup fee and GST charges will be refunded. In case of a refund, however, only the transaction amount will be refunded in INR as per the conversion rate applicable on the date of refund. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. **Credit Limit** Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit will be communicated to them at the time of card issuance. This will also be mentioned in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilized limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which a cardholder can make purchases. Cardholders may be entitled to apply for an enhancement of the Credit Limit after 12 months from the date of card issuance. CSB Bank also reserves the right to recommend a Credit Limit increase to the Cardholders based on their Edge CSB Bank Credit Card and Edge+ CSB Bank Credit Card usage, in the Jupiter app. This recommendation and its associated terms and conditions will be made available for the Cardholder to consider before accepting the recommendation. Once the Cardholder has read and agrees to the Terms related to Credit Limit increase displayed inside the Jupiter app and provided their consent to increase the limit, their Credit Limit will be enhanced. Cardholder\u2019s acceptance of the limit increase recommendation where they specifically validate the limit increase and agree to the terms will be treated as a consent. The Bank or its authorized third party service provider, will keep the digital records of such consent and will treat it as proof of consent in case of any dispute arising later on account of limit increase. CSB Bank will review the Cardholder\u2019s account periodically and reserve the right to decrease their credit limit based on their transaction patterns, payment behavior and other internal criteria. This will be informed to the Cardholder via the Jupiter app and/or via email and SMS. **Billing** **1\\. Payment Schedule** The billing cycles have been illustrated based on examples below Cycle Duration| Statement Generatio n Date| Payment Due Date| 3 Day Grace Period| Date from when interest shall be levied| Late Payment Fee ---|---|---|---|---|--- 7th May - 6th Jun| 6th Jun | 21st Jun | 22nd to 24th Jun | 22nd Jun | Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 24th of Jun (11:59 PM) 17th May to 16th Jun| 16th Jun | 1st Jul | 2nd to 4th Jul | 2nd Jul | Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 4th Jul (11:59 PM) 27th May to 26th Jun| 26th Jun | 11th Jul | 12th to 14th Jul | 12th Jul | Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 14th Jul (11:59 PM) ---|---|---|---|---|--- **2\\. Billing statements** The Cardholder\u2019s billing statement will be generated every month. It will contain a break-up of all purchases, payments, fees, interest charges, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used in a month, the statement will mention there were no spends in that month. Jupiter App also has an option to view and download the statement in PDF format. The Cardholder will also be sent a PDF copy of their monthly statement to their registered email address. The Cardholder shall, however, review the statement from time to time on Jupiter app in order to stay updated on the statement. Only settled transactions will be included in the monthly statement. In case a transaction done in a particular cycle has not been settled by the time of statement generation, it will be included in the next cycle. As per the Network Partner guidelines, merchants are given up to a maximum of 10 days to settle domestic transactions and 15 days to settle international transactions. In case a transaction is not settled in this timeframe, the transaction amount will be refunded to the Cardholder. After this, in case of late presentment of the transaction for up to 45 days from date of transaction, they can be charged again and their available limit reduced accordingly. Any transactions on which a dispute has been raised, will not be included in the monthly statement. **3\\. Minimum Amount Due** The Cardholder will need to pay at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date as indicated in the monthly statement. If they have paid the Minimum Amount Due, they will be liable to pay interest only on the outstanding amount and can continue to earn and redeem rewards. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due (reduced by any amount that has been credited and/ or refunded and/ or repaid by the Cardholder and/ or waived off by Bank before the payment due date) + EMI amount billed for the month + 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes If the minimum amount due is less than \u20b9500, the Cardholder will be charged \u20b9500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than \u20b9500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. Note- _Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment stretching over months / years with consequential compounded interest payment on your outstanding balance._ **4\\. Payment knock-off order:** When the Cardholder makes a payment, it is adjusted in this order: \\- Taxes \\- Fees \\- Interest \\- Purchases Furthermore, purchase amounts are knocked off starting with the earliest transaction date. **5\\. How Refunds/Reversals/Waivers/Chargebacks impact the statement** The Cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due on the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming transactions only up to Rs. 5000 or 1% of the Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit (whichever is lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. **6\\. Method of payment** The Cardholder can pay the outstanding dues from the Jupiter app using the following modes: \\- Bank transfer from their bank account on Jupiter App or other Registered Bank Account. - UPI payments (up to \u20b92 lakh) from any Bank Account added to the Jupiter UPI App. - Via debit card and net banking of any bank account using a unique payment link sent to the Cardholder via SMS and email. \\- CSB Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. **7\\. Billing disputes resolution** All the contents of the statement will be deemed to be correct and accepted if the Cardholder does not inform us of any discrepancies within 30 days of the statement\u2019s generation date. In the event of billing disputes/discrepancies, we shall investigate and confirm the liability for such transactions. For any disputes which result in a chargeback being raised, we may offer a temporary credit during the period of investigation, which may be reversed along with applicable charges subject to outcome of the investigation.

Statements are generated on the 1st and are due on the 15th of every month. There is no outstanding at the start of the following cycle. Date| Details ---|--- 2 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b910000 1 April, 2023| Statement generated * Total Amount Due: \u20b910,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9 500 15 April, 2023| Payment due * Total Amount Due: \u20b910,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9500 21 April 2023| Payment of \u20b9 2000 made 1 May 2023| Late payment charge of \u20b9 200 applied 1 May 2023| GST of \u20b9 36 on the Late Payment Charge added to bill _Note: Late Payment Charge is not applicable when the total outstanding is less than \u20b9500._ ******Interest Charges****** 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date| Details ---|--- 5 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b910,000 27 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b95000 1 April, 2023| Statement generated * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 15 April, 2023| Payment due * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 19 April, 2023| Transaction of \u20b91000 21 April 2023| Payment of \u20b92000 made 4\\. On statement dated 1 May 2023, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 --- Details| Reason| Amount| Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) | Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9579.45| (10000 x 48 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) | Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date| \u20b998.63| (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b95,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) | Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b9431.51| (10000 x 35 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b91,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) | * Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction * Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date | \u20b914.79| (1000 x 12 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable| Sum of all the above charges| \u20b91124.38| (\u20b9579.45 + \u20b998.63 + \u20b9431.51 + \u20b914.79) GST in applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9202.39| 18% x 1124.38 _Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged._ **Interest Free Period** The interest free period could range from 13 to 47 days. _Example for the calculation of interest free period: _ For a statement for the period from May 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2023. Assuming that the cardholder has paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: 1. For a purchase dated May 2, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 45 days. 2. For a purchase dated May 30, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank India \u201c**RBI** \u201d) post the payment due date during which if the Cardholder makes a payment, they will not be charged late payment or interest charges. **Forex Markup Fee** If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled which may not be the same date on which the transaction was made. If the transaction is not in USD (US Dollars), the amount will first be converted to USD, and then the USD amount will be converted to INR as per the rate provided by VISA. On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied, and GST will be applicable on the markup fee. If this transaction is reversed, both the markup fee and GST charges will be refunded. In case of a refund, however, only the transaction amount will be refunded in INR as per the conversion rate applicable on the date of refund. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. #### **Credit Limit** Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit and cash limit will be communicated to them at the time of card issuance. This will also be mentioned in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which a cardholder can make purchases. Cardholders may be entitled to apply for an enhancement of the Credit and/or Cash Limit after 12 months from the date of card issuance. Federal Bank also reserves the right to recommend a Credit Limit increase to the Cardholders based on their Edge Federal Bank Visa Credit Card usage, in the Jupiter app. This recommendation and its associated terms and conditions will be made available for the Cardholder to consider before accepting the recommendation. Once the Cardholder has read and agrees to the Terms related to Credit limit increase displayed inside the Jupiter app and provided their consent to increase the limit, their Credit Limit will be enhanced. Cardholder\u2019s acceptance of the limit increase recommendation where they specifically validate the limit increase and agree to the terms will be treated as a consent. The Bank or its authorised third party service provider, will keep the digital records of such consent and will treat it as proof of consent in case of any dispute arising later on account of limit increase. The Federal Bank will review the Cardholder\u2019s account periodically and reserve the right to decrease their credit limit based on their transaction patterns, payment behaviour and other internal criteria. This will be informed to the Cardholder via the Jupiter app and/or via email and SMS. #### **Billing** 1. **Payment Schedule** The billing cycles have been illustrated based on examples below. Cycle Duration| Statement Generation Date| Payment Due Date | 3 Day Grace Period | Date from when interest shall be levied | Late Payment Charges ---|---|---|---|---|--- 1st May - 31st May| 1st June| 15th June| 16th to 18th June | 16th June| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 18th of June (11:59 PM) 6th May to 5th June | 6th June| 20th June| 21st to 23th June| 21th June| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 23rd June (11:59 PM) 11th May to 10th June | 11th June| 25th June| 26th to 28th June| 26th June| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 28th June (11:59 PM) 19th May to 18th June | 19th June| 3rd July| 4th to 6th July| 4th July| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 6th July (11:59 PM) 21st May to 20th June | 21st June| 5th July| 6th to 8th July| 6th July| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 8th July (11:59 PM) 26th May to 25th June | 26th June| 10th July| 11th to 13th July| 11th July| Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 13th July (11:59 PM) **2\\. Billing statements** The Cardholder\u2019s billing statement will be generated every month. It will contain a break-up of all purchases, payments, fees, interest charges, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used in a month, the statement will mention there were no spends in that month. Jupiter App also has an option to view and download the statement in PDF format. The Cardholder will also be sent a PDF copy of their monthly statement on their registered email address. The Cardholder shall, however, review the statement from time to time on Jupiter in order to stay updated on the statement. Only settled transactions will be included in the monthly statement. In case a transaction done in a particular cycle has not been settled by the time of statement generation, it will be included in the next cycle. As per the Network Partner guidelines, merchants are given up to a maximum of 10 days to settle domestic transactions and 15 days to settle international transactions. In case a transaction is not settled in this timeframe, the transaction amount will be refunded to the Cardholder. After this, in case of late presentment of the transaction for up to 45 days from date of transaction, they can be charged again and their available limit reduced accordingly. Any transactions on which a dispute has been raised, will not be included in the monthly statement. **3\\. Minimum Amount Due** The Cardholder will need to pay at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date as indicated in the monthly statement. If they have paid the Minimum Amount Due, they will be liable to pay interest only on the outstanding amount and can continue to earn and redeem rewards. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due (reduced by any amount that has been credited and/ or refunded and/ or repaid by the Cardholder and/ or waived off by Jupiter before the payment due date)\\+ EMI amount billed for the month \\+ 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes --- If the minimum amount due is less than \u20b9500, the Cardholder will be charged \u20b9500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than \u20b9500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. **4.****Payment knock-off order:****** When the Cardholder makes a payment, it is adjusted in this order: * Taxes * Fees * Interest * Purchases Furthermore, purchase amounts are knocked off starting with the earliest transaction date. **5\\. How Refunds/Reversals/Waivers/Chargebacks impact the statement** The Cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge Federal Bank Visa Credit Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due of the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming transactions only up to \u20b95000 or 1% of the Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit (whichever is lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. **6\\. Method of payment** The Cardholder can pay the outstanding dues from the Jupiter app using the following modes: * Auto-debit from their Federal bank account. This auto-debit will be initiated at 10 AM on the payment due date * Bank transfer from their Federal bank account or another other Registered Bank Account. * UPI payments (up to \u20b92 lakh) from any VPA added to the Jupiter App. * Via debit card and net banking of any bank account using a unique payment link sent to the Cardholder via SMS and email. Federal Bank have the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. **7\\. Billing disputes resolution** All the contents of the statement will be deemed to be correct and accepted if the Cardholder does not inform us of any discrepancies within 30 days of the statement generation date. In the event of billing disputes/discrepancies, we shall investigate and confirm the liability for such transactions. For any disputes which result in a chargeback being raised, we may offer a temporary credit during the period of investigation, which may be reversed along with applicable charges subject to outcome of the investigation. Any GST levied will not be reversed in any dispute on fees and charges or interest. **8\\.

These limits will be mentioned in your monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which you can make purchases. ### **Billing Statement** Your billing statement will be generated every month and sent to your registered email address (Refer to the MITC or Jupiter App for the exact dates based on your Billing cycle) It will contain a break-up of all fees, purchases, interest charges, repayments, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used during the billing cycle, the billing statement will mention there were no spends in that month. ### **Minimum Amount Due** When you receive your Edge-Federal Card statement, you can choose to pay the total amount due or or the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due \\+ EMI amount billed for the month \\+ 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes --- If the minimum amount due is less than \u20b9500, you\u2019ll be charged 500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than \u20b9500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. The Minimum Amount Due should be paid before the Payment Due Date. The remaining balance can be carried forward to subsequent months. Note, that paying the minimum amount due would still incur you finance charges on the unpaid bill amount. ### **Method of payment** You can pay the outstanding dues from the mobile app using the following modes: \u2022 Auto-debit from your bank account \u2022 Bank transfer from your bank account \u2022 UPI payments (up to \u20b92 lakh or any other such amounts prescribed from time to time) from any virtual payment account added to the Jupiter App. \u2022 Via debit card and net banking through any bank account using a unique payment link sent to you via SMS and email Federal Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. ### **Interest-Free (grace) period** Interest-free period, from the start of the billing cycle date, shall be 13 - 47 days (depending on the date of the transaction). However, the interest-free period will not be available if you fail to pay the total amount due of the previous month. The payment due date for the Edge-Federal Credit Card comes at least 14 days after the Statement Generation Date (Please check your statement for your exact Payment Due Date). Therefore, the interest free credit period can range from 13 - 47 days depending on the date of your credit card transaction. #### **Illustrative Example for Interest-Free Period Calculation** For a statement for the period from May 1, 2023 to May 30, 2023 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2023. Assuming that you have paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: 1. For a purchase dated May 2, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 45 days. 2. For a purchase dated May 30, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: 1. If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. 2. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. 3. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (\u201c**RBI** \u201d) post the payment due date during which if you make a repayment, it is considered a timely repayment. ### **Illustration of Interest Charges** 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the TAD of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date| Details ---|--- 5 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b910,000 27 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b95000 1 April, 2023| Statement generated * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 15 April, 2023| Payment due * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 19 April, 2023| Transaction of \u20b91000 21 April 2023| Payment of \u20b92000 made On statement dated 1 May 2023, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 --- Details| Reason| Amount| Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) | Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9579.45| (10000 x 48 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) | Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date| \u20b998.63| (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b95,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) | Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b9431.51| (10000 x 35 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b91,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) | * Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction * Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date | \u20b914.79| (1000 x 12 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable| Sum of all the above charges| \u20b91124.38| (\u20b9579.45 + \u20b998.63 + \u20b9431.51 + \u20b914.79) GST in applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9202.39| 18% x 1124.38 _Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged._ ### **Billing disputes resolution** In the event the Card Member disagrees with the charges indicated in the statement, it should be communicated to Bank by calling Customer Care on +91 86550 55086 within 30 days of receipt of the statement, failing which it would be construed that all charges indicated in the statement are accepted by you.

Illustrative example for calculation of Late Payment Charge: In the example below, consider the billing cycle is 1st of the calendar month - end of the month. Statements are generated on the 1st and are due on the 15th of every month. There is no outstanding at the start of the following cycle. _Note: Late Payment Charge is not applicable when the total outstanding is less than \u20b9500._ **Interest Charges** 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. 2. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date| Details ---|--- 5 March, 2024| Transaction of \u20b910,000 27 March, 2024| Transaction of \u20b95000 1 April, 2024| Statement generated * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 15 April, 2024| Payment due * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 19 April, 2024| Transaction of \u20b91000 21 April, 2024| Payment of \u20b92000 made 4\\. On statement dated 1 May 2024, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 --- Details| Reason| Amount| Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) | Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9473.42| (10000 x 48 x (3% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) | Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date| \u20b978.90| (8000 x 10 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b95,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) | Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b9345.21| (10000 x 35 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b91,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) | * Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction * Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date | \u20b911.84| (1000 x 12 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable| Sum of all the above charges| \u20b9909.37| (\u20b9473.42 + \u20b978.90 + \u20b9345.21 + \u20b911.84) GST in applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9163.69| 18% x 909.37 _Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged._ **Interest Free Period** The interest free period could range from 13 to 47 days. Example for the calculation of interest free period: For a statement for the period from May 1, 2024 to May 31, 2024 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2024. Assuming that the cardholder has paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: 1. For a purchase dated May 2, 2024, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2024 to June 15, 2024, i.e. 45 days. 2. For a purchase dated May 30, 2024, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2024 to June 15, 2024, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank India \u201c**RBI** \u201d) post the payment due date during which if the Cardholder makes a payment, they will not be charged late payment or interest charges **Forex Markup Fee** If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled which may not be the same date on which the transaction was made. If the transaction is not in USD (US Dollars), the amount will first be converted to USD, and then the USD amount will be converted to INR as per the rate provided by international network partners of RuPay . On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied, and GST will be applicable on the markup fee. If this transaction is reversed, both the markup fee and GST charges will be refunded. In case of a refund, however, only the transaction amount will be refunded in INR as per the conversion rate applicable on the date of refund. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. #### **Credit Limit** Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit will be communicated to them at the time of card issuance. This will also be mentioned in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which a cardholder can make purchases. Cardholders may be entitled to apply for an enhancement of the Credit Limit after 12 months from the date of card issuance. CSB Bank also reserves the right to recommend a Credit Limit increase to the Cardholders based on their Edge CSB Bank Credit Card usage, in the Jupiter app. This recommendation and its associated terms and conditions will be made available for the Cardholder to consider before accepting the recommendation.

It will contain a break-up of all purchases, payments, fees, interest charges, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used in a month, the statement will mention there were no spends in that month. Jupiter App also has an option to view and download the statement in PDF format. The Cardholder will also be sent a PDF copy of their monthly statement on their registered email address. The Cardholder shall, however, review the statement from time to time on Jupiter app in order to stay updated on the statement. Only settled transactions will be included in the monthly statement. In case a transaction done in a particular cycle has not been settled by the time of statement generation, it will be included in the next cycle. As per the Network Partner guidelines, merchants are given up to a maximum of 10 days to settle domestic transactions and 15 days to settle international transactions. In case a transaction is not settled in this timeframe, the transaction amount will be refunded to the Cardholder. After this, in case of late presentment of the transaction for up to 45 days from date of transaction, they can be charged again and their available limit reduced accordingly. Any transactions on which a dispute has been raised, will not be included in the monthly statement. **3\\. Minimum Amount Due** The Cardholder will need to pay at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date as indicated in the monthly statement. If they have paid the Minimum Amount Due, they will be liable to pay interest only on the outstanding amount and can continue to earn and redeem rewards. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due (reduced by any amount that has been credited and/ or refunded and/ or repaid by the Cardholder and/ or waived off by Bank before the payment due date)\\+ EMI amount billed for the month \\+ 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes --- If the minimum amount due is less than \u20b9500, the Cardholder will be charged \u20b9500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than \u20b9500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. **4\\. Payment knock-off order:** When the Cardholder makes a payment, it is adjusted in this order: * Taxes * Fees * Interest * Purchases Furthermore, purchase amounts are knocked off starting with the earliest transaction date. **5\\. How Refunds/Reversals/Waivers/Chargebacks impact the statement** The Cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge CSB Bank Credit Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due on the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming transactions only up to \u20b95000 or 1% of the Cardholder\u2019s Credit Limit (whichever is lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. **6\\. Method of payment** The Cardholder can pay the outstanding dues from the Jupiter app using the following modes: * Auto-debit from their bank account on Jupiter App. This auto-debit will be initiated at 10 AM on the payment due date * Bank transfer from their bank account on Jupiter App or other Registered Bank Account. * UPI payments (up to \u20b92 lakh) from any Bank Account added to the Jupiter UPI App. * Via debit card and netbanking of any bank account using a unique payment link sent to the Cardholder via SMS and email.

In the event of billing disputes/discrepancies, we shall investigate and confirm the liability for such transactions. For any disputes which result in a chargeback being raised, we may offer a temporary credit during the period of investigation, which may be reversed along with applicable charges subject to outcome of the investigation.

In case your credit limit is breached due to a higher amount presented by the merchant at the time of settlement, there will be no charges levied._ _** TDS wherever applicable shall be deducted for the customer as per the rates notified by the government from time to time._ _*** Fuel surcharge waiver will be offered on fuel spends of up to Rs.4000 per billing cycle_ **Withdrawal Limits** Your Credit Limit will be communicated to you at the time of card issuance. These limits will be mentioned in your monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. \u201cAvailable Credit Limit\u201d is the limit up to which you can make purchases or withdraw cash from an ATM respectively. Cash limit is a subset of your credit limit i.e. up to 20% of your Credit Limit and is assigned based on your usage patterns, payment behaviour and credit history. It will only be activated after 180 days from the date of issuance of the Edge-Federal Card. After this 180 day period, your cash limit will be made available at the sole discretion and on such terms as may be communicated by Federal Bank from time-to-time. **Billing Statement** Your billing statement will be generated every month and sent to your registered email address (Refer to the MITC or Jupiter App for the exact dates based on your Billing cycle) It will contain a break-up of all fees, purchases, interest charges, repayments, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used during the billing cycle, the billing statement will mention there were no spends in that month. **Minimum Amount Due** When you receive your Edge-Federal Card statement, you can choose to pay the total amount due or the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due \\+ EMI amount billed for the month \\+ 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes --- If the minimum amount due is less than Rs. 500, you\u2019ll be charged 500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than Rs. 500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. The Minimum Amount Due should be paid before the Payment Due Date. The remaining balance can be carried forward to subsequent months. Note, that paying the minimum amount due would still incur you finance charges on the unpaid bill amount. **Method of payment** You can pay the outstanding dues from the mobile app using the following modes: Auto-debit from your bank account Bank transfer from your bank account * UPI payments (up to Rs. 2 lakh or any other such amounts prescribed from time to time) from any virtual payment account added to the Jupiter App. * Via debit card and net banking through any bank account using a unique payment link sent to you via SMS and email Federal Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. **Interest-Free (grace) period** Interest-free period, from the start of the billing cycle date, shall be 13 - 47 days (depending on the date of the transaction). However, the interest-free period will not be available if you fail to pay the total amount due of the previous month. The payment due date for the Edge-Federal Credit Card comes at least 14 days after the Statement Generation Date (Please check your statement for your exact Payment Due Date). Therefore, the interest free credit period can range from 13 - 47 days depending on the date of your credit card transaction. **Illustrative Example for Interest-Free Period Calculation** For a statement for the period from May 1, 2023 to May 30, 2023 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2023. Assuming that you have paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: 1. For a purchase dated May 2, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 45 days. 2. For a purchase dated May 30, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: 1. If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. 2. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. 3. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (\u201c**RBI** \u201d) post the payment due date during which if you make a repayment, it is considered a timely repayment. **Illustration of Interest Charges** 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (\u201c**TAD** \u201d) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. 2. Additionally, interest will be levied on all cash advances from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the TAD of the previous month\u2019s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date| Details ---|--- 5 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b910,000 27 March, 2023| Transaction of \u20b95000 1 April, 2023| Statement generated * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 15 April, 2023| Payment due * Total Amount Due: \u20b915,000 * Minimum Amount Due: \u20b9750 19 April, 2023| Transaction of \u20b91000 21 April 2023| Payment of \u20b92000 made On statement dated 1 May 2023, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 --- Details| Reason| Amount| Calculation ---|---|---|--- Interest on \u20b910,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) | Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment| \u20b9473.42| (10000 x 48 x (3% x12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b98,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) | Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date| \u20b978.90| (8000 x 10 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b95,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) | Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date| \u20b9345.21| (10000 x 35 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Interest on \u20b91,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) | * Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn\u2019t apply on this transaction * Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date | \u20b911.84| (1000 x 12 x (3% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable| Sum of all the above charges| \u20b9909.37| (\u20b9473.42 + \u20b978.90 + \u20b9345.21 + \u20b911.84) GST in applicable on interest charges| GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges| \u20b9163.69| 18% x 909.37 _Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged._ **Billing disputes resolution** In the event the Card Member disagrees with the charges indicated in the statement, it should be communicated to Bank by calling Customer Care on +91 86550 55086 within 30 days of receipt of the statement, failing which it would be construed that all charges indicated in the statement are accepted by you.

While the minimum due may seem like a small, manageable payment, relying on it regularly can lead to long-term financial stress. This article explains what a credit**card minimum amount due** means, how it\u2019s calculated, the consequences of paying only the minimum, and how to manage it smartly. ## What Does \u201cMinimum Amount Due\u201d Mean on a Credit Card? The **minimum amount due** is the **smallest sum you must pay by the due date** to keep your credit card account in good standing and avoid late payment fees. It\u2019s usually **5% of the total outstanding balance** , but it also includes any **EMIs** , **past dues** , and **other charges**. ### EMI + Outstanding Balance + Charges = Minimum Due Your statement\u2019s minimum due is not a random figure.

If your bill is \u20b920,000 and you only pay \u20b91,000, the bank won\u2019t fine you, but you\u2019ll still pay **interest on the remaining \u20b919,000**. This keeps adding up. It\u2019s okay once in a while, but not a healthy habit. Always try to pay the full amount when possible. ## How Is the Minimum Due Calculated? Here\u2019s a breakdown of a sample calculation: ### Example: Credit Card Minimum Due Calculation Component| Amount (\u20b9) ---|--- Total Outstanding| \u20b925,000 EMI Due| \u20b92,000 Previous Month's Minimum Due| \u20b9500 Charges & Late Fees| \u20b9200 Minimum Amount Due| \u20b92,700 Most banks including **HDFC Bank** , **SBI Card** , **ICICI** , and **Axis Bank** use this approach, although exact methods may vary slightly. ## Should You Only Pay the Minimum Due? Technically, yes, you can just pay the minimum due to avoid penalties. But should you? ### Interest Implications of Partial Payments When you pay only the minimum: * **No late fee** is charged * **Interest is still applied** on the unpaid balance * **New purchases** may start attracting interest immediately * Interest is calculated daily and **compounded monthly** , leading to higher debt over time ### Why Paying Only Minimum Hurts Credit Health Consistently making minimum payments can: * Increase your overall interest cost * Push you into a **minimum payment trap** * Negatively affect your **credit score** due to high credit utilization ## What Happens If You Don\u2019t Pay the Minimum? Missing even the **minimum due** can trigger: * **Late payment penalties** (\u20b9300 to \u20b91,200 depending on bank) * **Interest charges** on the entire outstanding balance * **Reporting to credit bureaus** like CIBIL, impacting your credit score ## \u2018No Minimum Due\u2019 - What Does It Mean? Sometimes your card statement might say **\"No Minimum Due\"**. This usually means: * You have **no new transactions** * You\u2019ve **paid the full amount** already * There is **no outstanding balance** This is a good sign, but always double-check your statement to be sure. ## Credit Card Minimum Amount Due vs Total Due Here\u2019s how the **minimum due** compares to the **total amount due** : ### Comparison Table: Minimum Due vs Total Due Criteria| Minimum Amount Due| Total Amount Due ---|---|--- Mandatory to Avoid Fees| Yes| No Interest on Balance| Yes| No Credit Score Impact| Neutral| Positive Financial Burden| Lower| Higher (short-term) ## How to Avoid Interest Even After Paying the Minimum * **Always try to pay the total due** , not just the minimum * If you can\u2019t pay in full, aim to pay more than the minimum * Avoid using your card for new purchases until you clear the balance * Consider converting large purchases into **EMIs** with lower interest rates * Use tools like **auto-pay** or reminders to never miss a payment ## FAQs on Credit Card Minimum Amount Due ### Q1. What is the credit card minimum amount due? It is the smallest amount you must pay to avoid late fees. However, you\u2019ll still be charged interest on the remaining balance. ### Q2. What happens if I only pay the minimum amount due? You avoid penalties but interest keeps accruing on the unpaid amount, increasing your total debt. ### Q3. Is it okay to pay only the minimum due every month? Only in emergencies. Doing it repeatedly leads to high interest and potential debt traps. ### Q4. What does it mean when the statement says \u2018No Minimum Due\u2019? It means there's nothing to pay for the current cycle \u2014 either because you\u2019ve already paid in full or have no new dues. ### Q5. How is the minimum due calculated? It usually includes 5% of your total due, EMI amounts, any past dues, and charges.

This means you can\u2019t withdraw, deposit, or transfer money until the issue is resolved. This action is typically initiated in response to legal orders, suspicious activity, or regulatory requirements. In simple terms, your account is locked \u2014 and any financial transactions are blocked until the freeze is lifted. **Example:** If your account is frozen due to suspected fraud, even automatic payments like EMIs or bill payments won\u2019t go through. 'Account seized' is somewhat a similar term.

Meaning, Features, Application & Benefits \u00b7 4 min read ### IN THIS ARTICLE **Aadhaar** (\u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930 in Hindi) means **foundation** , and that's exactly what it is for India's digital identity ecosystem. Aadhaar is a **12-digit unique identity number** issued by the **Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)** to Indian residents. It links an individual's biometric and demographic information to create a unified identity system used for government services, financial inclusion, and digital authentication. In this article, you'll learn what Aadhaar means, how it works, how to apply for one, and why it plays such a crucial role in everyday life, from LPG subsidies to SIM card activation. The correct spelling is 'Aadhaar' for the Aadhaar Card. It's neither 'Aadhar' nor 'Adhaar'. **Fascinating Fact:** As of 2024, Aadhaar has become the world's largest biometric ID system, with over , making it more comprehensive than any other national identity program globally. ## **How to explain 'Aadhaar' in simple words to kids** Aadhaar is like a **super ID card**. It has your **name, photo, and fingerprints** , and gives you a number that only **you** have. It's used to prove who you are when you want to get gas, a new SIM card, or money from the government. Think of it as a **digital key** that opens doors only for you. ## Aadhaar: The Foundation of India's Digital Identity ### History of Aadhaar and UIDAI Launched in **2009** , Aadhaar was introduced by the **Government of India** under the **Digital India initiative**. Spearheaded by **Nandan Nilekani** , UIDAI was established to manage and implement the system. The primary goal was to streamline welfare distribution and eliminate fake beneficiaries by assigning a **unique digital identity** to every resident. **Fascinating Fact:** by April 2025, with the system now handling over 90 million authentication requests daily, making it one of the most actively used digital identity systems in the world. ### Aadhaar's Role in Digital India Aadhaar forms the **backbone of India's digital public infrastructure** , enabling seamless delivery of services such as **subsidies, banking, pensions** , and even **vaccination programs**. It is used for **eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer)** , **direct benefit transfers** , and **identity authentication** , transforming governance through technology. ## Key Features of Aadhaar Card You Should Know ### 12-digit Unique Number Every individual is assigned a random, unique 12-digit Aadhaar number. This number is not based on caste, religion, geography, or income. ### Biometrics and Demographics Aadhaar captures both biometric data (fingerprints, iris scans, facial photograph) and demographic data (name, age, gender, address). This ensures accurate identification without the need for physical documents. **Fascinating Fact:** In January 2025 alone, , showing a remarkable 32% year-on-year growth compared to January 2024's 214.8 crore transactions. ### Voluntary but Widely Used While , it has become essential for accessing numerous public and private services, including welfare schemes, bank accounts, and mobile SIMs. ## **How to Apply for Aadhaar: Process, Documents & Tips** ### **Documents Required** To apply for Aadhaar, carry the following: * **Proof of Identity (POI)** \u2013 PAN card, Passport, Driving License * **Proof of Address (POA)** \u2013 Utility bill, Ration card, Bank statement Check the UIDAI document list for full eligibility. ## Uses of Aadhaar in Daily Life and Government Schemes ### Government Subsidies (LPG, Ration) Aadhaar with bank accounts, beneficiaries receive **Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT)** for **LPG subsidies** , **fertilizers** , and **PDS ration schemes** , reducing corruption and middlemen. ### Bank Account Verification (eKYC) Banks use Aadhaar for **instant eKYC** , simplifying the account opening process and enabling paperless onboarding. ### SIM Card Linking Mobile operators verify customer identity via Aadhaar to ensure secure and fast activation of SIM cards. ## Aadhaar vs PAN Card, Voter ID & Passport: What\u2019s the Difference? Feature| Aadhaar| PAN Card| Voter ID| Passport ---|---|---|---|--- Unique ID Number| Yes| Yes| Yes| Yes Biometric Data Included| Yes| No| No| No Address Proof| Yes| No| Yes| Yes Mandatory?| No| Yes (for tax)| Yes (for voting)| No Digital Accessibility| Yes| Yes| No| No In other words, Aadhaar combines identity, address proof, and biometrics into a single digital document \u2014 unlike other IDs that serve limited purposes. ## Privacy Concerns and Legal Standing of Aadhaar ### Supreme Court Judgment In **2018** , the **Supreme Court of India** upheld Aadhaar\u2019s constitutionality. It ruled Aadhaar is **valid for welfare schemes and PAN linkage** , but **not mandatory for services like telecom or bank accounts**. ### Criticism & Data Security Measures Concerns have been raised about **data privacy, surveillance, and consent**. UIDAI introduced: * **Virtual IDs** (VID) for masked authentication * **Limited KYC** to reduce data sharing * **Biometric lock/unlock** features on the UIDAI portal Despite criticism, Aadhaar continues to be central to **Digital India\u2019s trust infrastructure**. ## Aadhaar's Meaning Across A Few Indian Languages Language| Translation (Aadhaar)| Meaning in Context ---|---|--- Hindi| \u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930| \u0928\u0940\u0902\u0935, \u090f\u0915 \u0921\u093f\u091c\u093f\u091f\u0932 \u092a\u0939\u091a\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0932\u0940 (UIDAI \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0917\u0908) Marathi| \u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930| \u0913\u0933\u0916 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0921\u093f\u091c\u093f\u091f\u0932 \u0913\u0933\u0916 Tamil| \u0b86\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd| \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb3 \u0b8e\u0ba3\u0bcd, \u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5 \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb3 \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd Kannada| \u0c86\u0ca7\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd| \u0caa\u0ccc\u0cb0\u0cb0 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0c96\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cc6, \u0cad\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ca4\u0ca6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cbf \u0c85\u0ca8\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0caf \u0c97\u0cc1\u0cb0\u0cc1\u0ca4\u0cc1 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0c96\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cc6\u0caf\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cbf \u0cac\u0cb3\u0cb8\u0cb2\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cc1\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0ca6\u0cc6 Bengali| \u0986\u09a7\u09be\u09b0| \u09a1\u09bf\u099c\u09bf\u099f\u09be\u09b2 \u09aa\u09b0\u09bf\u099a\u09af\u09bc, \u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09a4\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09a8\u09be\u0997\u09b0\u09bf\u0995\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09cd\u09af \u098f\u0995\u099f\u09bf \u098f\u0995\u0995 \u09aa\u09b0\u09bf\u099a\u09af\u09bc \u09b8\u0982\u0996\u09cd\u09af\u09be Gujarati| \u0a86\u0aa7\u0abe\u0ab0| \u0a86\u0aa7\u0abe\u0ab0 \u0aa8\u0a82\u0aac\u0ab0, \u0aad\u0abe\u0ab0\u0aa4\u0aa8\u0abe \u0aa8\u0abe\u0a97\u0ab0\u0abf\u0a95\u0acb\u0aa8\u0ac0 \u0a93\u0ab3\u0a96 \u0aae\u0abe\u0a9f\u0ac7 Telugu| \u0c06\u0c27\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d| \u0c06\u0c27\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d \u0c38\u0c02\u0c16\u0c4d\u0c2f, \u0c2d\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c24\u0c26\u0c47\u0c36\u0c02\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c27\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c24 \u0c17\u0c32 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c2a\u0c41 \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c27\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c02 Malayalam| \u0d06\u0d27\u0d3e\u0d7c| \u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d7d \u0d06\u0d27\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d02, \u0d2d\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d24\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d21\u0d3f\u0d1c\u0d3f\u0d31\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d7d \u0d10\u0d21\u0d3f \u0d2a\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d27\u0d24\u0d3f ## How can you explain this to your kids?

A Credit Card EMI allows users to convert a large purchase made with a credit card into smaller, more manageable monthly installments. Instead of paying the full amount at once, you can chose to repay the amount in parts. Your bank will provide the feature to pay the amount back over a predefined tenure with applicable interest rate. ## What is a Credit Card EMI Calculator? A Credit Card EMI Calculator is a tool that helps you figure out how much you will pay each month if you convert a large purchase on your credit card into EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments). ### How it works: When you buy a product like a laptop, phone or an appliance\u2014 you don\u2019t always have to pay the full amount upfront. Some banks offer EMI option on your Credit Card payment. With EMI, you can break the total cost into smaller monthly payments over a set period.

They consider your income, the length of the loan, interest rates, and any existing monthly EMI payments you have. They also check the EMI to Net Monthly Income (NMI) ratio, which is a guideline to ensure you can afford the loan. Some lenders might also use a different method called the multiplier method to calculate your eligibility. Keep in mind that the amount you can borrow may differ from one lender to another. This is because each lender has its own criteria, such as interest rates and the EMI/NMI ratio. To get a clearer picture of how much you can borrow, it's a good idea to use the home loan eligibility calculator available on the lender\u2019s website. ### 3\\. Is there any relaxation in the home loan repayment schedule? Many lenders offer options for flexibility in the home loan repayment schedule, especially if you encounter financial difficulties. This can include options like extending the loan tenure or temporarily reducing the EMI amount. It\u2019s important to discuss these options with your lender if you feel you may need some breathing room in your repayment schedule. Always make sure to read the terms and conditions associated with any changes to your loan.

Calculate Home Loan EMI? are calculated using a formula that considers three key factors: 1\\. **Principal Loan Amount (P):** The total amount you borrow from the lender. 2\\. **Interest Rate (R):** The annual interest rate charged by the lender on the loan amount. 3\\. **Loan Tenure (N):** The total duration (in years) for which you repay the loan. The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = / The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P \u00d7 r \u00d7 (1+r)n (1+r)n-1 Where: * PPP is the principal loan amount * r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) * n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example Let\u2019s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: * Loan Amount (P): \u20b930,00,000 * Annual Interest Rate: 8% * Loan Tenure: 20 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8 12 \u00d7 100 = 0.00667 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 20 \u00d7 12 = 240 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 \u00d7 0.00667 \u00d7 (1+0.00667) 240 ( 1+0.00667 ) 240 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 \u00d7 0.00667 \u00d7 4.9307 4.9307 - 1 EMI = 98663.307 3.9307 EMI \u2248 \u20b925,100 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of \u20b930,00,000 at an 8% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately \u20b925,100. ## Benefits of Using a Prepayment Calculator for Home Loan 1. **Quick and Convenient:** Using a home loan EMI calculator is straightforward. Just enter some basic details, and you'll get your results in seconds. Plus, it's completely free and doesn't require any registration. 2. **Accurate Estimates:** Get reliable results without any manual calculation errors. 3. **Compares Loan Offers:** Easily compare different loan options side-by-side to find the best fit for your needs. 4. **Detailed Breakdown:** See a clear picture of how your repayments will be structured, including EMI amounts. 5. **Plan Your Tenure:** The calculator can help you choose a loan term that aligns with your financial situation. ## Home Loan EMIs Payment Options 1. **Online Transfers with Net Banking:** Pay your EMI through online platforms from your computer or phone using your bank's mobile app. Ensure a secure internet connection and follow your bank's instructions for security. 2. **Unified Payments Interface (UPI):** Connect your bank account to a UPI app and make payments quickly and easily. UPI offers instant and secure transfers. 3. **In-Person Payments at the Bank:** Visit your bank branch to make your payment over the counter. This allows you to speak with a bank representative if you have any questions. 4. **ECS (Electronic Clearing Service):** Authorise your bank to automatically deduct the EMI amount from your account on the due date, eliminating the need for paper checks or visiting a branch. 5. **Mobile Wallets:** Use mobile wallet apps to manage your EMI payments. These apps offer features like transaction history, alerts, and reminders. 6. **Cheque Payments:** Submit a cheque for your EMI payment at the bank branch. Cheques provide a physical record of payment but can be slower due to processing times. 7. **Electronic Standing Instruction (e-Mandate):** Set up automated payments through e-Mandate for recurring payments. It combines the ease of automatic deductions with the speed of online platforms. 8. **National Automated Clearing House (NACH):** Similar to ECS, NACH handles large numbers of transactions electronically. Authorise your bank to automatically deduct your EMI payment. ## Charges Applicable on Non-payment of Home Loan EMIs 1. **Late Payment Penalties and Fees:** Missing an EMI payment can result in late fees, interest on the overdue amount, and other penalties depending on your lender's policies. Typically, late fees range from 1% to 2% of the EMI amount due. 2. **NACH/SI/Cheque Bounce Charges:** These charges apply when a home loan payment fails due to insufficient funds in the linked account or if the account is closed. 3. **Negative Impact on Credit Score:** Making on-time payments helps build a good credit score. Missing a payment can lower your credit score significantly and affect the credit score of someone who co-signed your loan application. 4. **Can Affect Transfer Eligibility:** Missed payments can make it harder to qualify for a balance transfer to a new lender with a lower interest rate. 5. **Non-Performing Asset (NPA) Status:** If you miss your first two loan payments, your lender will send reminders. If you haven't made a payment in 90 days, your loan may be classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). 6. **Increased Costs for Subsequent EMI Payments:** Missing a home loan EMI can result in increased future payments due to added late fees and penalties. ## What Factors Affect Your Home Loan EMI? 1. **Loan Amount (Principal):** The total sum you borrow for your home purchase. A larger loan amount translates to a higher EMI payment. 2. **Interest Rate:** The interest rate offered by the bank determines how much you pay in addition to the loan amount. A higher interest rate translates to a higher EMI. 3. **Processing Fee:** The processing fee covers the cost of reviewing your home loan application. It's usually a percentage of the loan amount or set as a fixed fee. 4. **Loan Tenure:** Longer loan tenures result in lower monthly EMIs but higher total interest paid over time. Shorter tenures lead to higher monthly EMIs but lower total interest. 5. **Prepayments:** Making extra payments towards your home loan can significantly impact your EMIs. These prepayments reduce the outstanding principal amount, leading to lower EMIs. ## What are Flexible and Fixed Home Loan EMIs? While most home loan EMIs are fixed throughout the loan term, they might change in some situations: 1. **Flexible Home Loan EMIs:** Step-up loans gradually increase your EMI amount over the loan term, while step-down loans see a decrease in EMI as time goes on. 2. **Partly Disbursed Loan:** You may encounter pre-EMIs initially if your loan is disbursed in stages. 3. **Impact of Rising Floating Interest Rates:** If the repo rate changes, it can affect your floating interest rate. If the interest rate goes up, your lender might extend your loan term or increase your EMI. 4. **Home Loan Prepayment:** Making additional payments towards your home loan principal can affect your EMIs. You can lower your EMI amount or shorten the loan term. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### What is a home loan amortisation schedule?

A take home salary/ in-hand calculator is an automated tool that helps you figure out your net salary after taxation. It also considers all the bonuses and deductions applicable. You must provide the gross salary and total bonus. The calculator will then determine the CTC and show you the amounts of basic salary, HRA, other allowances, deductions for provident fund and professional tax, total deduction, net salary, income tax, and net salary after income tax deduction. ## How to use a Salary Calculator? The process to use the salary calculator is quick and simple. Follow the three steps given below: **Step 1:** Choose if you want to calculate monthly or yearly salary. **Step 2:** Enter the gross salary and total bonus amount to determine Cost to Company (CTC). **Step 3:** Input the basic salary percentage of the CTC. The calculator may consider the basic salary as 50% of the CTC by default. You may change it as per your need. Once you enter the required details, the calculator will instantly provide the following information. * Basic Salary * HRA * Other Allowances * Provident Fund * Professional Tax * Total Deductions * Net Salary * Income Tax * Net Salary Post Tax Jupiter's Salary Calculator tool can also help you calculate salary per month. Just toggle the 'Yearly/Monthly' option to 'Monthly'. ## Components of Your Salary Slip In every professional field, employees get paid at the end of the month by their employers. This payment is called the salary. The amount they receive is usually mentioned in their contract as well as the pay slip. The salary has many components that may vary among different employers. Below is a list of the most common breakdown of the salary structure. ### 1\\. Basic salary It is a part of the Cost to Company (CTC) that the employers pay to the employees for their services. The basic salary is generally around 40% to 50% of your total salary. There is no formula to calculate this amount. It depends on factors like the industry, employee designation, and much more. ### **2\\. House Rent Allowance (HRA)** Companies pay the to employees who stay in a rented property. The HRA amount equals 50% of the basic salary if you live in metro cities. For the non-metro cities, the amount is 40% of your basic salary. (13A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes the HRA partially or fully tax exemptible. But, if you do not stay in a rented property, the entire component is taxable. ### **3\\. Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)** Employers pay this benefit for you and your family\u2019s domestic travel expenses during a holiday. The allowance only covers railway ticket prices and airfares. Section 10(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers tax exemption on the LTA amount for up to two holidays in a four-calendar-year block. You need to submit proof of travel to receive the tax benefit. ### **4\\. Special Allowance** This is a fixed amount your employer may pay above your basic salary. The Special Allowance varies among companies as it depends on multiple factors. Moreover, it is fully taxable. ### **5\\. Bonus** Bonus is a component of the gross salary that the employers may pay as a performance encouragement. The entire bonus amount is fully taxable. ### **6\\. Employee Provident Fund (EPF)** It is generally a mandatory savings scheme. You need to pay 12% of your basic salary as an EPF contribution. Moreover, your employer matches your contribution and invests the same amount in your EPF account. Your contribution is tax-deductible up to \u20b91.5 lakhs , 1961. The employer\u2019s contribution to EPF is a part of the CTC, and it does not appear on the . ## Salary Calculation Formula As the salary calculations involve various components, you need to use different formulas to calculate each aspect. Only then you can estimate your take-home salary. Here are some important salary calculation formulas that you must know. **Take-Home Salary =** Gross Salary \u2013 (Income Tax + Employee Provident Fund (EPF) + Professional Tax (if applicable)) **Gross Salary =** Basic Salary + Allowances + Bonuses + Overtime Pay (if applicable) **Gratuity =** (Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance) \u00d7 15 \u00d7 (Years of Service) \u00f7 26 **Taxable Income =** Gross Salary - EPF/PPF Contribution - Tax-Free Allowances - HRA - LTA - Health Insurance Premiums - Tax-Saving Investments (e.g., 80C, 80D) - Other Deductions (e.g., Standard Deduction, Home Loan Interest) ## How to Calculate Monthly Take-Home Salary? Your monthly take-home salary is the amount that remains after subtracting the total deductions from gross pay. Let us understand the calculations using examples. **1\\. Gross Salary:** \u20b91,000,000 **2\\. Deductions:** * Basic Salary (50% of Gross Salary): \u20b91,000,000 \u00d7 50% = \u20b9500,000 * Employee Provident Fund (EPF Contribution) \u2013 12% of Basic Salary: \u20b9500,000 \u00d7 12% = \u20b960,000 * Professional Tax (average): \u20b92,500 (varies by state) **3\\.

Take-Home Salary:** Gross Salary - Total Deductions = \u20b91,000,000 - \u20b91,12,500 = \u20b98,87,500 Final Take-Home Salary: **\u20b98,87,500** ## How to Calculate Take Home Salary After Taxes? Everyone is curious what their take home pay will be once an organization decides the appraisal for the employee or share the new offer letter to a candidate. Let's breakdown how to calculate take home pay after the taxation. Firstly you have to find out your taxable income. All the variables are explained above as well. **Assumptions:** * Gross Salary: \u20b91,000,000 * EPF Contribution: 12% of basic salary (assuming basic salary is 50% of gross salary) * HRA Exemption: We\u2019ll assume 40% of basic salary as HRA and 50% of that as exempt. * LTA Exemption: \u20b920,000 (assumed) * Health Insurance Premium: \u20b915,000 (assumed under Section 80D) * Tax-Saving Investments (e.g., under 80C): \u20b9150,000 (maximum allowed) * Standard Deduction: \u20b950,000 (as per 2023-24 rules) Now, let\u2019s calculate each component. For a gross salary of \u20b91,000,000, the taxable income is calculated as \u20b9605,000, after accounting for EPF, HRA exemption, LTA, health insurance premiums, tax-saving investments, and the standard deduction. **Breakdown of Deductions:** * EPF Contribution (12% of basic salary): \u20b960,000 * HRA Exemption (50% of HRA): \u20b9100,000 * LTA Exemption: \u20b920,000 * Health Insurance Premium: \u20b915,000 * Tax-Saving Investments (80C): \u20b9150,000 * Standard Deduction: \u20b950,000 Total deductions: 60,000 + 100000 + 20000 + 15000 + 150000 + 50000 = 395000 Net Taxable Income after Taxes: \u20b910,00,000 - 3,95,000 = **6,05,000** Total deductions reduce the gross salary to arrive at the taxable income of **\u20b9605,000**. ## How to Calculate Gratuity? Gratuity = (Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance) \u00d7 15 \u00d7 (Years of Service) \u00f7 26 * Gross Salary = \u20b91,000,000 * Basic Salary = 50% of Gross Salary = \u20b9500,000 * Dearness Allowance (DA) = \u20b90 (Assumed) * Years of Service = 20 years **Calculation:** Basic Salary = \u20b9500,000 (50% of \u20b91,000,000) Dearness Allowance (DA) = \u20b90 (Assumed DA is not applicable) Total of Basic Salary + DA = \u20b9500,000 + \u20b90 = \u20b9500,000 Gratuity Calculation: Gratuity = (500,000) \u00d7 15 \u00d7 20 26 = ( 500,000 \u00d7 300 ) 26 = 150,000,0000 26 = **\u20b95,769,231** **Gratuity Amount :- \u20b95,769,231** ## **Benefits of Salary Calculator in India** **Quick Results:** Jupiter\u2019s salary calculator shows take-home pay within seconds. **Tracks Changes:** It helps you understand changes in your salary when you receive bonuses or deductions. **Clear Breakdown:** The calculator gives a clear view of each part of your salary, including all amounts and deductions. **Budgeting Help:** your take-home pay after taxes, the calculator is useful for planning monthly expenses and savings. **Supports Decisions:** When considering a job offer or a raise, the calculator adjusts to show your new salary structure, helping you make informed choices about income, cost of living, and taxes. **Negotiation Tool:** With a breakdown of gross and net pay, the calculator is helpful during salary discussions to make sure offers match your needs. **Detailed Deductions:** Jupiter\u2019s CTC calculator also provides details on monthly and yearly deductions, plus contributions toward EPF from both you and your employer. ## Some commonly searched salaries Please note that this is just for informational purposes only.

This is because gold is considered as a symbol of wealth. Although gold is bought mainly for the purpose of consumption in the form of jewellery, it is an excellent investment alternative as it acts as a perfect hedge against inflation and market volatility. We all know that gold can be purchased physically. But with technological advancements buying gold digitally is also possible. Read to find out the different forms of gold investment and how to save for investing in gold. ## Why invest in gold? Before we get to how to save money for gold, let\u2019s see why you should invest in gold. ### Gold is equivalent to money Our ancestors used gold as a legal tender for a long time. Even after various other forms of currency emerged, gold remained store value for all the countries. Even today, countries keep gold in their reserve as a cover against economic distress and hyperinflation. ### Gold can never be zero Gold has been in existence for over 3,000 years now. However, not once did this metal become zero. Despite facing so many uncertainties and crises, the value of gold always remained above all assets, making it one of the most reliable assets. ### It acts as an inflation hedge When inflation rises, the value of all currencies goes down. However, the value of gold has always gone up. Take, for example, the last decade; the value of gold has quadrupled. This proves that in the long run, the value of gold will always go up and give better returns than a savings instrument and beats inflation. ### Liquidity Gold is the most liquid investment. This is because it is universally accepted by anyone in the world. Be it a jeweller, a pawn shop, or an online dealer, all accept gold and give cash against it. Moreover, it can be carried easily in your pocket. The process of selling gold is also quite easy, and you don't have to wait for days to get money. Any person buying gold from you will give you cash immediately. This is not the case with any other asset. ### Investing in gold doesn\u2019t need specialized skills Investing in gold is very straightforward. Gold doesn't require special skills, unlike stocks, mutual funds, and other financial assets. You don't have to do market research or regularly monitor your investment. You can just buy your gold and store it safely. ### Acts a saviour in times of distress Gold can act as a hedge against market volatility. Moreover, in times of crisis, you can take a loan against your gold or sell it to finance an emergency expense. ### Portfolio diversification Gold is an excellent diversification tool. This is because it has a negative correlation with most asset classes. This means that when the market is in a freefall, gold can protect the value of the portfolio. Hence to reduce the downside risk of your portfolio, you can add gold to it. ### Wealth creating asset In the long-term, gold has given very high returns and hence can be a very good investment. The value of 10 grams of gold in 2000 was Rs 4,400, and today it is Rs 59,890. That's a 1261% return in 23 years. This means that, on average, the value of gold has increased by 12% every year for the last 23 years. ## How to save money for gold? Saving money for gold is just like saving money for any other goal of yours. All you have to do is set aside some money regularly to buy gold at the end of a certain tenure. But to save, you need to cut down on unnecessary expenses. Only if you spend less will you have enough to save which will help you fulfil all your financial goals. Below are some of the ways you can start saving money. ### Save cash at home The most conventional and popular way of saving money is in cash. You can save it in the rice box as your mother does or keep it in the locker. But make sure it is out of your sight so you won\u2019t spend it unnecessarily. ### Save in a bank account One alternative to saving money in cash is saving at a bank. A savings account is as liquid as cash, and you can withdraw money from it anytime. One bonus of saving money in a bank is that you can earn some interest on the money you save. Moreover, saving money in the bank is much safer than in cash. ### Invest in fixed deposit Fixed deposits (FDs) are among the most popular saving instruments, giving guaranteed returns. Moreover, FDs give higher returns than savings bank accounts. They come in different tenure options ranging from seven days to ten years, so you can choose the one that suits your goal the best. You can choose short-term FDs for short-term goals and long-term FDs for long-term goals. Although you cannot break your FD in between the tenure, you can take a loan against it or opt for premature withdrawal at a penalty. ### Save in Jupiter Pots Saving money in Jupiter Pots is similar to saving money in a piggy bank. But the only difference is that you will save money virtually and not physically. Through Pots, you can save for individual goals and earn exciting interest rates for your investment. This way you are not only saving money, you are earning money from the money you have kept in Pots. You can rename the Pot, set a target amount, and also enable the auto-save option to be consistent. There is no lockin for Pots unless you choose Super Pots. Once you reach the target amount, the Pot will be destroyed, and the money will be transferred into your Jupiter Bank account. ### Invest in mutual funds Mutual funds are a popular investment avenue as they have the potential to give inflation-beating returns. You can invest in mutual funds for your short-term and long-term goals. In case you want to purchase gold in the next one to two years, debt funds, especially ultra-short-term or short-term mutual funds, are the best. However, for long-term goals (more than five years), equity funds are the best. You can start a SIP (systematic investment plan) to ensure consistency in investment. You can choose any method to save money to buy gold, but only consistency will help you reach your goal. Also, remember to save every bonus or gift money to get to fulfil your goal faster. ## How to invest in gold for beginners? As beginners, you must know the different forms of gold available for investment. The following are the most popular forms of gold. ### Buying physical gold The most popular form of buying gold is in physical form. You can buy physical gold in the form of jewellery from a trusted jewellery shop. Alternatively, you can buy gold coins or bars. In both cases, you need to check the purity and quality of gold. ### Gold savings scheme A gold saving scheme is like a recurring deposit. You can deposit a certain sum every month with a jeweller, and at the end of tenure, you can purchase gold with the total deposit money. However, the jeweller doesn't pay any interest on the money you deposit. To make up for the interest, the jeweller offers a discount or cash incentive on the last deposit. With gold becoming costlier for the middle class, this scheme can help buy gold by saving regularly. ### Digital gold on apps like Jupiter Money Buying digital gold is easier than buying physical gold. Moreover, there is no hassle of storage, nor do you have to worry about the purity. Apps like Jupiter Money allow you to invest in gold which is 24 Karat at 99.99% purity. You can purchase gold with an amount as low as Rs 100, hence it is very affordable. Every time you purchase gold, it is stored in a vault, so you don't have to worry about safety. The best part is that you can convert digital gold to physical gold anytime you want. ### Sovereign gold bonds Sovereign gold bonds are government securities issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). They are issued against grams of gold, and the minimum investment is one gram. The maximum investment is the value equivalent to 4 kgs of gold. These bonds pay a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum and have a fixed tenure of eight years. However, premature withdrawal is allowed after the fifth year. Moreover, you can sell the bonds in the secondary market at the current gold price. If you sell the bonds before maturity, the capital gains are subject to tax as per the current tax rules. However, holding it until maturity means you don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on capital gains. The interest is taxable as per your income tax slab rate. ### Gold mutual funds Gold funds are mutual funds that invest directly or indirectly in gold. They either invest in physical gold, gold-producing companies, or gold mining companies. The primary purpose of these funds is to create wealth by protecting against market volatility. They are highly liquid and can be redeemed anytime. Since they are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), they are considered safe. Moreover, you can invest in them through SIP, making an investment in gold easy and affordable. ### Gold ETFs Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are passive mutual funds that track the price of physical gold in the domestic market. They invest in gold bullion but are available to investors in dematerialized format. Since gold ETFs are listed on the stock exchange, they offer dual benefits of the flexibility of stock market investing and the convenience of investing in gold. When you redeem gold ETFs, you do not get physical gold; instead, you will get its cash equivalent. To invest in gold through ETFs, you must have a demat account and should buy the units during market trading hours. Gold ETFs best suit investors who want to benefit from the benefit from the price of gold rather than own physical gold. ## Gold Monetisation Scheme The Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) is a program launched by the Government of India in 2015 (Source: ) with the objective of utilizing the vast amount of idle gold held by households, institutions, and trusts for productive purposes. The Government also realized the importance of reduction of reliance on foreign countries for import of gold. Instead of letting gold sit idle in lockers, the scheme allows individuals and entities to deposit their gold with banks and earn interest on it while ensuring its safety. The minimum deposit under the scheme at any one time shall be raw gold (bars, coins, jewellery excluding stones and other metals) equivalent to 10 grams of gold of 995 fineness (995 fineness gold is 24-karat gold, i.e. 99.5% gold and 0.5% other metal for alloy mixture).

Read on to know more about this scheme. ## What is ELSS? ELSS includes diversified equity funds that invest most of the corpus in the shares of listed companies as per the fund investment philosophy. The investee companies are chosen across different market capitalization and industries. The primary objective of ELSS funds is to maximize the returns over the long term. The fund manager chooses the listed companies after in-depth research to deliver optimal risk-adjusted returns to the investors. ## What are the features of ELSS funds? Some of the features of ELSS mutual funds are as follows: * At least 80% of the fund corpus is invested in equities and equity-related instruments. * Any income earned is considered as long-term capital gains (LTCG) and taxed as per the existing rules. * Fund corpus is diversified across different industries, market capitalization, and sectors. * Your investment is eligible for tax benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. * The minimum lock-in period is three years with no maximum limit for the investment horizon. ## Who should invest in ELSS? ### Salaried individuals A portion of your salary may be invested in Employee Provident Fund (EPF), which is a fixed-income instrument. Therefore, to enjoy tax benefits while balancing the risk and return on your overall investment portfolio, opting for an ELSS scheme is advisable. ### First-time investors If you are starting your investment journey, ELSS is a good option to understand the workings of mutual funds and equity. Although these financial products entail certain risks, if you stay invested for five years or longer, this risk can be mitigated. ## What are the benefits of ELSS? ### Tax benefits offered by ELSS funds The ELSS tax-saving benefit is available on the principal investment for an amount of up to INR 1.50 lakhs per year under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the investment has a three-year lock-in period. You may redeem it after three years and the gains are taxed as LTCG, which are tax-free for up to INR 1 lakh per annum. Any additional returns exceeding INR 1 lakh are taxed at 10% without any indexation benefits. ### Other benefits In addition to the ELSS tax benefits, some other advantages are as follows: * Shorter lock-in period Compared to options like National Pension System (NPS) and Public Provident Fund (PPF), ELSS has a shorter lock-in period, which is of three years. NPS investment is locked in until retirement and PPF has a 15-years lock-in period. * Regular income If you choose the dividend option while investing in ELSS, you can earn a regular income during the lock-in period. This additional income can help in meeting your day-to-day expenses and reduce your financial burden. * Possibility of earning higher returns Compared to other tax-saving instruments like PPF and fixed deposits (FDs), ELSS offers the opportunity to earn higher returns on your investments. Unlike fixed-income products, ELSS can deliver market-linked returns, helping you accumulate more wealth in the long run. ## Why you should invest in ELSS ### Diversification Most of these schemes invest in different types of companies across various sectors ranging from small-cap to mid-cap to large-cap. Therefore, you can benefit from the diversification of your investment risk. ### Low minimum investment You may invest in ELSS for as little as INR 500, which makes it easy for you to opt for this type of fund. You may start the investment without waiting to accumulate a sizeable corpus. ### Systematic investment plan (SIP) You can invest a lump sum in an ELSS. However, if you do not have adequate funds, you can opt for an SIP, which allows you to invest a certain amount at periodic intervals. This helps you to inculcate financial discipline, which can benefit in wealth accumulation over a longer period. ## Things to consider before investing in ELSS While making an ELSS investment, here are some important things you should consider before making your decision: ### Lock-in period ELSS has a three-year lock-in period during which you cannot withdraw your investment. Therefore, ensuring the amount invested will not be required for this term is important. ### Returns ELSS is a market-linked investment product and does not offer guaranteed or assured returns. The earnings are directly based on the performance of the underlying assets. Before investing, you may check the net asset value (NAV) and performance of various funds to determine what is outperforming. ### Investment duration Generally, equities perform better and deliver higher returns in the long term (five years or more). Therefore, while opting for ELSS, make sure you stay invested for a longer duration to maximize the benefits and mitigate the short-term market volatility and the related risk. ### Fund manager and history The fund managers make all the investment decisions, and therefore, ensuring they are competent and experienced is advisable. It is also recommended you opt for funds that have delivered consistent returns over the last five or 10 years. ## How to invest in ELSS? You may open an ELSS account online or offline with the fund house of your choice. You can invest either as a lump sum or an SIP based on your financial situation. The minimum amount you can invest is INR 500 with no upper limit. ## Best ELSS Funds Top-performing funds vary based on the returns; however, some of the best ELSS funds are listed below: **_Fund name_** | **_Three-year returns (%)_** | **_Five-year returns (%)_** ---|---|--- Quant Tax Plan Direct \u2013 Growth | 30.29 | 22.71 Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund Direct \u2013 Growth | 21.02 | 22.03 Canara Robeco Equity Tax Saver Direct \u2013 Growth | 19.91 | 19.05 IDFC Tax Advantage (ELSS) Direct Plan \u2013 Growth | 16.98 | 18.00 Motilal Oswal Long Term Equity Fund Direct \u2013 Growth | 14.67 | 17.46 ## SIP or lump sum: Which investment is better option? If you do not want to assume higher risk, you may opt for an SIP. This allows you to invest during different market cycles. Therefore, when the market is low, you can buy more units and vice versa, which reduces your average cost. Moreover, when the market rises, you can redeem the units for a higher price, delivering better returns. On the other hand, investing a lump sum is advisable if you want to stay invested for a longer period and are willing to assume more risk. ## Frequently asked questions (FAQs) ### What are ELSS funds?

And a major portion of the corpus is invested in equity and related investments. ### How to invest in ELSS? To begin with, you need to complete the know-your-customer (KYC) verification.

There are various tax-saving avenues where you may invest your money to reduce your tax liability. You have two options to save taxes; the first is tax deduction and the second is tax exemption. In this article, we have discussed the various tax-deduction investment options that are available. The most popular with multiple investment options is Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ## Best tax-saving investments under Section 80C Section 80C offers multiple tax-saving investments that can be categorized as government-backed and non-government schemes. The former offers fixed returns guaranteed by the government. Although the latter types of investments do not offer fixed returns, these are also good options to consider. Let us now look at seven government-backed investments. ### Employee Provident Fund (EPF) Your employer also contributes to the EPF to help you save for your retirement; however, this contribution is a part of your overall cost to the company (CTC). The minimum contribution is INR 1800 per month and the maximum is capped at 12% of the basic salary plus the dearness allowance (DA). Generally, EPF contribution is mandatory if your salary is less than INR 15000 per month. The primary goal of EPF is retirement; however, you can prematurely withdraw the amount under certain conditions. The rate of interest is changed every quarter. EPF is an exempt-exempt-exempt scheme\u2014the contribution, interest, and maturity amounts are all tax-exempt\u2014(EEE). Our will help you determine the amount of money generated by your EPF and how much you can expect to get at retirement. ### Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) If your company does not contribute to the EPF or if you want to save more for your retirement, you may opt for this tax-saving option. Since it is voluntary, there is no minimum and maximum contribution limit. Any salaried individual can invest in VPF that has a lock-in period of five years. The rate of interest is the same as EPF and modified quarterly. It is also EEE; however, if you withdraw before five years, the amount is taxable. ### Public Provident Fund (PPF) PPF can be opened by any individual with a minimum annual contribution of INR 500 and the maximum capped at INR 1.50 lakhs. PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years. However, you can partially withdraw some amount based on certain conditions or to avail of a loan against the PPF corpus. This is also an EEE scheme, which means the investment, interest, and maturity benefits are tax-exempt. The interest is declared by the government and modified quarterly. ### Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme (SSS) This tax-saving scheme is for girls aged below 10 years. Parents or guardians can contribute a minimum of INR 250 and a maximum of INR 1.50 lakhs per year in this scheme. 50% of the money can be withdrawn once the girl child attains the age of 18 years and the balance can be withdrawn on reaching 21 years. This scheme is also EEE with a quarterly updated rate of interest. ### National Savings Certificate (NSC) NSC is one of the most popular tax savings schemes in the post office. You can invest as little as INR 100 with no cap on the maximum contribution. NSC is available only for Indian residents and has a five-year lock-in period. Compared to the PF schemes, the rate of interest offered by NSC is slightly lower but is also revised quarterly. However, one limitation of the NSC is that the interest earnings are taxable. ### Five-year Post Office Fixed Deposits (FDs) FDs are a popular investment choice among Indians. The five-year post office FDs can be opened by any resident Indian with no minimum or maximum contribution limits. The lock-in period is five years; however, under certain conditions, premature withdrawal is allowed. The interest is modified quarterly and is taxable each year at your prevalent income tax slab rate. ### Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) The last government-backed 80C investment option is for senior citizens aged 60 years and above. The minimum and maximum contributions are INR 1000 and INR 15 lakh, respectively; however, the tax deduction is available only for investments up to INR 1.5 lakh. The SCSS comes with a lock-in period of five years, which can be extended in blocks of three years. Premature withdrawal based on certain conditions after one year from the date of opening the account is allowed. The interest can change quarterly, and the entire interest earned is taxed at your current slab rate. Let us now look at six non-government backed tax-saving investments under 80C. ### Bank Fixed Deposits FDs Bank FDs are popular and come with different tenures ranging from seven days to some years. However, tax-saving FDs have a lock-in period of five years. The contribution limits vary from one bank to another. Moreover, the rate of interest is slightly higher than the bank savings account and these earnings are taxable at your income tax slab rate. ### Insurance policies Insurance policies can be of different types like term plans, endowment policies, and much more. Any Indian resident can buy an insurance policy and the premium depends on the type of plan, your age, and other factors. The duration and earnings also vary based on the type of policy. Understanding the terms and conditions before investing is important. ### Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) ELSS is a type of mutual fund scheme that invests the corpus in shares, stocks, and equities. The minimum contribution can vary based on the chosen scheme and the fund house. The lock-in period is three years, which is the lowest for section 80C investments. However, the returns depend on the performance of the scheme and are subject to market conditions. ### National Pension System (NPS) It provides several tax benefits and any Indian aged between 18 and 60 years can open an NPS account. The minimum contribution is INR 1000 with no cap on the maximum amount. The NPS investment is locked until your retirement and premature withdrawal is subject to certain conditions. The returns depend on your chosen asset allocation between equity, debt, and balanced funds. Since a part of the NPS investment goes to equities, the returns are not guaranteed. Apart from the 1.50 lakhs deduction, an additional deduction of INR 50000 is available under section 80CCD (1B). Moreover, employer contributions of up to 10% of your basic salary plus DA are eligible for tax deductions under section 80CCD (2). ### Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) ULIPs combine insurance and investment wherein some portion of the premium is used for life cover and the remaining is invested in different asset classes. There is no limit on the contributions and the money is locked in for five years. The returns are not fixed and are linked to market performance. ### Infrastructure bonds Investments of up to INR 20,000 in these bonds are tax-exempt under section 80CCF. These have a five-year lock-in period with a tenure of up to 10 years. However, the entire interest earned on these bonds is taxable. Payment applicable for tax-saving deduction under section 80C The principal repaid on your home loan is also eligible for tax benefits under section 80C. Additionally, the deduction is available for stamp duty, transfer fees, and registration charges paid while purchasing a home. ## How to plan for tax-saving investments The various tax-saving investment options when used smartly can provide several benefits and align with your financial goals. However, you should consider your financial situation and investible surplus before putting money in one or more eligible tax saving investment schemes. ### Expenses that can be claimed as deductions under section 80C Individuals can also claim tax deductions on tuition fees paid for two children. The exemption is limited only to the fees and excludes coaching expenses, capitation fees, and other costs. ## How much tax can be saved under section 80C?

However, investments of only INR 1.50 lakhs per year are eligible for the tax benefits. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### What is section 80C under Chapter VI A?

If you plan your taxes well, these deductions and exemptions can help reduce your liability by a significant amount, especially if you are salaried. The most popular and commonly known section is 80C. It offers various deductions to help you avail of tax benefits. Moreover, section 80C has several sub-sections. In this post, we will discuss one of these, section 80CCD of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ## What is section 80CCD? This section provides tax deductions if you contribute to the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) or the National Pension System (NPS). Any contributions made by your employer to the NPS also qualify for deductions under this section. ## Why is section 80CCD important? The section 80CCD limit and provisions not only help you reduce your tax liability but also contribute towards your retirement corpus. The section is divided into two categories. Sub-section (1) relates to your contributions made towards eligible investments and sub-section (2) deals with your employer's contribution. When you regularly contribute to the eligible pension funds, you can accumulate a sizeable corpus over the long term. The money can be invested across various asset classes as per your requirements and risk appetite. On maturity, you can reinvest the corpus into an annuity plan to receive regular income post-retirement. ## Classification of section 80CCD For further clarification related to the deductions, this section is classified into two subsections. One of them lays down the rules associated with the available deductions for salaried and self-employed professionals. The other provides the regulations for contributions made by employers towards employees\u2019 NPS accounts. ## Section 80CCD (1) Section 80CCD (1) states the rules regarding your contribution towards eligible pension schemes like NPS. The deduction is available to everyone irrespective of whether you are a government or private employee or a self-employed professional. The provisions are applicable to all Indian citizens aged between 18 and 65 years contributing to NPS. Moreover, the rules also apply to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). The provisions under this subsection are as follows: * Maximum deduction: 10% of basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) or 10% of gross annual income * For self-employed professionals, the deduction is lower from INR 1.50 lakhs or 20% of their gross annual income * An amendment introduced in Budget 2015, provides an additional deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (1B) for salaried and self-employed individuals ## Section 80CCD (2) Sec 80CCD (2) provisions are related to investments made by employers in employees\u2019 NPS accounts. Employers may contribute to their employees\u2019 NPS accounts in addition to the contributions made to Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Employee Provident Fund (EPF). The company\u2019s contribution can be equal to or more than that of its employees. However, this subsection does not apply to self-employed professionals. As per the provisions, you may avail of tax deductions of up to 10% of your salary (including basic salary and DA) or the actual employer contribution to your NPS account. ## Terms and conditions for claiming section 80CCD tax deductions The terms and conditions to claim 80CCD deductions are as follows: * If you are salaried, the deductions are available for contributions made by you and your employer towards your NPS account. These are also available for contributions made by self-employed professionals to this scheme. * Central Government employees\u2019 deduction is capped at 14% of their salaries * The deduction is 10% of your salary (basic plus DA) or 10% of gross income (if you are self-employed); the maximum limit is INR 1.50 lakhs per year. * No maximum limit on the deduction for employers\u2019 contributions. * Additional deduction of INR 50,000 contributed to NPS is eligible for deduction under its sub-section (1B). * Deductions claimed under this section cannot be claimed under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961; maximum deduction under both sections is capped at INR 1.50 lakhs per annum. * Any benefits received from your NPS investment like monthly payouts or surrendered accounts are liable to tax as per your income tax slab rates. * If you reinvest the NPS benefits in an annuity plan, you are not liable to pay any tax on that. You can claim the deductions at the end of the financial year while filing your income tax returns (ITR). Furthermore, you need to provide proof of your contributions to be eligible for these deductions. ## Eligibility for claiming section 80CCD deductions * Salaried and self-employed individuals * Indian citizens as well as NRIs * Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is not eligible for deductions * Deduction under sub-section (1) is capped at INR 1 lakh; any balance contributions can be claimed under the sub-section (2) * Cash or check payments are accepted as a contribution ## What is the National Pension System (NPS)? NPS was introduced by the Central Government to provide the benefits of an organized pension scheme to Indians. Initially, the scheme was only for government employees but later, it was made available to all eligible citizens including private-sector employees and self-employed professionals. The primary objective of NPS is to enable you to build a sizeable corpus for your post-retirement years. The investment can help you to get a fixed monthly income to sustain your lifestyle during post-retirement. Some highlights of National Pension System are listed below: * Mandatory for government employees; private sector employees and self-employed professionals can make voluntary contributions. * You must continue your contribution until you reach the age of 65 years. * Tier 1 account is mandatory to benefit from the deductions available in the NPS section under the Income Tax Act, 1961. * The minimum contribution to a Tier 1 account is INR 500 per month or INR 6,000 per annum. * The minimum contribution to a Tier 2 account is INR 250 per month or INR 2,000 per year. * You can invest across different asset classes, such as equity funds, debt instruments like company bonds, government bonds, and securities, and others; however, the maximum investment allocated for equities is limited to 75% of your contribution. * Subject to certain conditions, you may partially withdraw up to 25% of the accumulated corpus. * On maturity, you can withdraw up to 60% of the corpus and reinvest the balance in an annuity plan. Putting money in NPS can be either done automatically or actively as discussed below: ### Auto-investing The allocation of the amount between equity and debt is automatic based on your age as per the government rules. Auto investing can be conservative, moderate, or aggressive, which primarily determines the amount invested in equity and related instruments. ### Active investing If you opt for active participation, you are responsible for all the investment decisions. Based on your requirements and risk appetite, you may invest up to 75% of the amount in equity and equity-related products. However, this limit reduces by 2.50% every year once you reach the age of 50 years. ## Deduction for contribution to NPS * The NPS 80CCD income tax deductions are divided into two sub-sections - (1) and (2) and the limits under these two are not overlapping. * Combined tax savings under this section and section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 are common and capped at a maximum of INR 2 lakhs per year. * The reinvested maturity benefits received from NPS are tax-exempt; however, monthly income or lump-sum payout on maturity are added to your income and taxed at the applicable income tax slab rate. Section 80CCD and its subsections relate to the tax benefits provided on contributions made to the Central Government-notified pension fund schemes. In addition to the sections mentioned above, there are other subsections under the Income Tax Act, 1961 that lay down the rules on the treatment of money, tax implications of premature withdrawals, and other terms and conditions related to your contributions into the pension fund schemes.

An increase in the cost can lead to an overall increase in the price of goods and services. It can also increase our cost of moving around and commuting, thus, messing with our budget. If you struggle with tracking your fuel expenses, a **fuel cost calculator can** help you. It is a tool that can calculate the fuel cost depending on the distance to be travelled, mileage of your car and the per-unit cost of fuel, both petrol and diesel. Using a calculator for fuel costs can help you anticipate the expenses on fuel and take necessary action to keep your budget on track. ## The formula for fuel cost calculation A fuel cost calculator help calculate estimated costs based on certain inputs, including, 1. Trip Distance (in km) 2. Fuel Efficiency (in km/litre) 3. Fuel Price (in Rs/litre) Once you have all this data, you can input them into the **fuel cost calculator.** Here is the formula: Fuel cost=(Trip Distance/mileage)X per unit price of Fuel ## How to estimate fuel costs? Jupiter\u2019s **fuel cost calculator** can help you estimate your annual expense on fuel in advance. For this, you will need to provide the following inputs to the calculator: 1. Your monthly income 2. Your Daily movement in car 3. Fuel Price 4. Mileage of your vehicle To get the right output from the **Petrol cost calculator** , you should know the accurate mileage of your vehicle. Suppose you do not know the mileage of your vehicle. In that case, you can calculate it by using the trip metre after filling the tank to full capacity and measuring the distance run at the next refill and the formula of the **Fuel Mileage Calculator.** For example, Ramesh fills his Honda City car with a tank capacity of 45 litres in full and sets the trip metre to 0. One week later, he asks the pump operator to fill his tank again and realises that the tank will take 30 litres of petrol. The trip metre shows a reading of 510 km, which means the car has run a distance of 510 km in one week and consumed 30 litres of petrol. Thus, the mileage of the car is 510/30 = 17 km/l. So, if Ramesh has to plan his next trip of 340 Km and the cost of the petrol is Rs. 120/litre, he can estimate the cost using the fuel cost calculator as (340/17) *120= 2400 INR, so he will keep aside a provision of Rs.2400 for the cost of fuel during the trip. ## Factors driving fuel prices Petrol and diesel are the products of crude oil. So, the price of fuel will depend on the price of crude oil that is decided internationally. Some factors that may impact petrol and diesel price include 1. Supply and demand: The supply of petrol depends on a handful of oil-producing countries in the Middle East and other countries like Russia, Brazil, and Venezuela. These countries control the price by limiting supply through a cartel. 2. Any geopolitical tension amongst these countries, like the current Russia-Ukraine war, pulls the price of the crude up; thus, the price of petrol and diesel also rises. 3. Price charged to dealers: The price charged by the Oil Marketing Companies to their dealers is an important determinant of the oil prices. 4. Commission structure: Commission paid by the Oil Marketing Companies to the dealers determines the price at which the petrol or diesel is available to the end consumer. 5. Central Excise duty: Excise duty levied by the central government on petrol and diesel form a significant part of their price. 6. Taxes: Additional taxes are levied by state governments that add to the fuel price. 7. Demand for Fuel: A higher demand for fuel in comparison to supply will push the prices up. With an increase in the number of vehicles these days, the demand is at an all-time high. 8. Consumption ratio of refineries: If the number of refineries is less, or they are operating at less efficiency, they will not be able to fulfil the demand and push the prices. 9. US-INR rate: Since India has to pay its oil import bill in US dollars, an increase in the price of USD vis-\u00e0-vis INR will make the oil costly and vice versa. ## GST and Fuel Prices In India, the prices of petrol and diesel do not come under the ambit of GST. The central and state governments impose excise duty and value-added tax on petrol and diesel prices. In fact, if petrol and diesel are brought under the ambit of GST, they will become cheaper for the consumers than the current levels, even if they are placed in the highest slab of the GST, i.e., 28%. There has been demand from certain sections to bring petrol and diesel under GST, but that would mean a loss of a big chunk of revenue, both for central and state governments. ## Fuel Prices in various Indian Cities Since the taxes and charges levied by different state governments on petrol and diesel prices are different, the prices of petrol and diesel vary widely across the states. Here is a table comparing fuel prices across the major cities in India. S.No| City| Petrol Price| Diesel Price ---|---|---|--- 1| New Delhi| 105.41| 96.67 2| Mumbai| 120.51| 104.77 3| Chennai| 110.85| 100.94 4| Kolkata| 115.12| 99.83 5| Hyderabad| 119.47| 105.47 6| Bengaluru| 111.09| 94.79 7| Lucknow| 105.25| 96.81 8| Jaipur| 118.01| 100.91 **5 effective ways of achieving fuel economy** Fuel is a limited resource. Since it has a high cost, you should do your best to save fuel wherever possible. Here are some things you can do to save fuel: 1. Drive Efficiently: Good driving practices go a long way in saving fuel. Regularly check the tire pressures in all the tires, switch off the engine when you are waiting at the signal and follow the speed limits, as unnecessary speeding will result in high fuel consumption. 2. Pay online and use rewards programs: Some credit card companies offer cashback and discounts on purchasing fuel. Understand and utilise this facility from your banking service provider 3. Keep your vehicle light: An Increase in weight can lead to low fuel efficiency for the car. So, avoid piling up unnecessary items in your vehicle and ease its load for maximum fuel efficiency. 4. Do carpool: Carpooling while going to the office or sending your kids to school can be an efficient way to save fuel. 5. Timely Servicing and maintenance of the vehicle go a long way in keeping the mileage of the vehicle optimum, thus saving fuel. ## FAQs 1. How do I use the fuel**cost calculator**?

The Employee Provident Fund (EPF), also known as , is a retirement benefit scheme that private sector companies offer to their employees. This scheme comes under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, to ensure the financial security of private-sector employees. The Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) regulates the scheme. Under this structure, both employers and employees contribute an equal amount to the fund. Simply put, you invest a portion of your monthly salary in the PF, and your employer adds the same value to the fund. You receive the income generated from the PF after retirement. Thus, EPF assists in providing financial security even after retirement or loss of employment. Read on to learn how to calculate the proceedings from your PF account using our **PF Calculator**. ## What Is PF Calculator? Our calculator will help you determine the amount of money generated by your EPF and how much you can expect to get at retirement. Our online **EPF calculator** : * Eliminates the need for calculating the PF amount manually every month. * Eliminates the need of tracking changes in the PF interest rate as our calculator uses the current rate automatically. * Informs you about any recent changes, contributions, or transactions after every use. Our notifications help you stay up-to-date with the PF account and any regulation introduced by the EPFO. * It comes with the assurance that the information regarding your EPF remains accurate every time. ## How to Calculate EPF? Before understanding the formula used for our EPF calculator, you need to have an idea about a few details, such as the basic monthly salary and , your EPF contribution percentage, the employer\u2019s contribution, and the interest rate. To explain the PF calculation formula, let us assume that your basic monthly salary with Dearness Allowance (DA) is \u20b915,000, your contribution to EPF is 12% of the amount, and the employer\u2019s contribution towards EPF is 3.67%. The employers invest the remaining 8.33% in the Employee Pension Scheme. **As per the above illustration:** Your contribution to the EPF will be 12% of \u20b915,000 = \u20b91,800 Your employer\u2019s investment in EPS will be 8.33% of \u20b9 15,000 = \u20b91,250 Your employer\u2019s contribution towards EPF will be your contribution minus the employer\u2019s contribution towards the EPS = \u20b91,800 - \u20b91,250 = \u20b9550 Hence, the total monthly contribution to the PF account will be \u20b91,800 + \u20b9550 = \u20b92,350 With the current yearly interest rate of 8.5%, you will get a monthly interest rate of 8.50%/12 = 0.70% (approximately). The value of the PF fund on your joining month will be \u20b92,350, as the employers do not pay any interest for the first month. The following month, the total contribution will become \u20b92,350 + \u20b92,350 = \u20b94,700. You will also receive an interest of \u20b94,700 x 0.7083% = \u20b933.29. The PF calculation uses the same formula for the subsequent months. ## Benefits of EPF Scheme Some of the essential include: * You can avail of its multiple tax exemptions. The interest earned, any withdrawal made after the first five years of employment, and maturity returns from the EPF offer tax benefits. Additionally, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your contribution to the PF tax-deductible. However, the interest earned from the EPF is tax-free only if your yearly contribution is under \u20b92.5 lakh. If it is over this amount, you will have to pay a tax on the interest income. * You can make withdrawals from the PF in case of any financial or medical emergency before the scheme\u2019s maturity. * You can add a family member as your nominee to the PF. If an unfortunate event leads to your absence, the nominees will receive the accumulated PF amount. * You also get a life insurance cover under the EPF, ensuring the financial security of your nominees. Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI)1976 rules offer this benefit. * You can withdraw the money from your PF after two months from the date of resignation if you decide to leave the job. * You also have the option to use the Volunteer Provident Fund feature of PF, which allows you to contribute more than 12% if you so wish. ## Changes in PF interest rates over the years EPFO\u2019s Central Board of Trustees consults with the Ministry of Finance to determine the **EPF interest rate** every year. Here is a list of the interest rate over the last six financial years. FY| Interest Rate ---|--- 2016-17| 8.65% 2017-18| 8.55% 2018-19| 8.65% 2019-20| 8.50% 2020-21| 8.50% 2021-22| 8.10% 2022-23| 8.15% 2023-24| 8.25% ## How to check your EPF account balance online Understanding is necessary to determine your profits from the scheme.

The main purpose of an FD is to help you save money. In FD, you can invest a certain sum of money at a predetermined rate of interest for a fixed tenure. The interest is higher than the savings account. At the end of the tenure, you will receive the investment and interest amount in a lump sum. ## How Does Fixed Deposit Work? A fixed deposit account is very different from a current or savings account offered by banks. In a current or savings account, the bank allows you to withdraw money as and when you like. However, in a fixed deposit account, the bank blocks the amount for a fixed tenure chosen by you. It pays an interest against the blocked amount at the end of the tenure. At the end of the tenure, you can either renew the FD or withdraw the amount. You cannot withdraw the investment amount during the tenure. In case you want to withdraw it, the bank will charge a penalty on the interest before giving you the amount. ## Features of Fixed Deposits Following are the features of fixed deposits: 1. **Investment:** the minimum amount of investment for fixed deposits is Rs 1,000 and varies from bank to bank. A fixed deposit allows you to invest only in a lump sum. You cannot make subsequent investments in the same FD. In case you want to invest more in FDs, you must open a new FD account. 2. **Tenure:** The tenure of FDs ranges from seven days to ten years. You can choose your tenure based on when you want your money. 3. **Returns:** Interest on fixed deposits is compounded quarterly but paid at the time of maturity. The returns are guaranteed, and there is no loss of capital. 4. **Premature withdrawal:** Some banks allow premature withdrawal of FDs; however, they will charge a penalty of up to 1% on the interest amount for premature closure. 5. **Renewal:** Upon maturity, the FD can either be renewed or withdrawn. Some banks automatically renew the FD, while some don't. If it is not automatically renewed, you must renew it. The renewal process is very simple and easy and can be done online. 6. **Loan against FDs:** In case you need money urgently, banks allow you to avail of a loan against your FD and save you from prematurely closing it. The terms of the loan vary from bank to bank. ## Types of Fixed Deposits There are several types of fixed deposits that banks offer. Following are some of the most common types of FDs: 1. Normal fixed deposits 2. 3. Cumulative and non-cumulative fixed deposits 4. Flexi fixed deposits 5.

Moreover, the money in the bank account can be used at any time, but you cannot break an FD whenever you want. 3. **Flexible tenure:** FDs have flexible tenure options. Banks offer FDs from seven days to ten years, and each tenure has a different interest rate. 4. **Multiple accounts:** You can open multiple FD accounts in your name.

Whether you want to buy a home or car or wish to go on your dream vacation, you can finance it with housing, automobile, or personal loan, respectively. These funds are available for a specific period and entail a certain rate of interest. Several parameters including loan tenure, interest rate, and amount determine the repayment installment. Most lenders provide online calculators that allow you to determine the approximate monthly installment payable. These calculators are easy to use and provide instant results, allowing you to make informed decisions. ## What is an EMI calculator? Most loans are repaid in equated monthly installments (EMIs). Knowing the approximate EMI amount you will have to pay can help you plan your finances well. This ensures you have no difficulty in making payments on time. An online EMI calculator can be beneficial in understanding the estimated installment and help you make an informed financial decision. ## How to calculate EMI Online EMI is the monthly installment you pay the lender over the loan tenure until the entire amount is fully repaid. The EMI comprises the principal repayment and the interest. Generally, the total amount of the principal and interest is divided by the loan duration to calculate the monthly installment. Often, the interest component in the EMI is higher during the initial loan tenure and it gradually decreases over a period. Although the EMI remains constant during the entire loan duration, the allocation towards principal repayment and interest changes with every repayment. ## Formula to calculate EMI online for a personal loan, home loan, and car loan The mathematical formula of calculating the EMI is as follows: E = P * r * (1+r) ^ n / where E is the EMI P is the loan principal amount r is the rate of interest n is the loan duration For example, if you borrow INR 5 lakhs for a period of three years at an 8.5% per annum rate of interest, the EMI is INR 15,784. Let us use the above formula to calculate the approximate EMIs on different types of loans. Using an online personal loan EMI calculator, here is the breakdown between principal and interest payment. Loan Amount | INR 5,00,000 ---|--- Loan Tenure | 3 years Rate of Interest | 14% per annum Total Interest | INR 1,15,204 EMI Amount | INR 17,089 The table below shows the breakdown for a housing loan using a home loan EMI calculator: Loan Amount | INR 50,00,000 ---|--- Loan Tenure | 20 years Rate of Interest | 7.1% per annum Total Interest | INR 43,75,840 EMI Amount | INR 39,066 Let us now look at the approximate EMI for an auto loan using an online car loan EMI calculator. Loan Amount | INR 7,00,000 ---|--- Loan Tenure | 5 years Rate of Interest | 8.2% per annum Total Interest | INR 1,55,660 EMI Amount | INR 14,261 The above calculations are based on no prepayment or delays. If you decide to partially prepay some of the outstanding loan amount, the EMI will change, and you can check this by adjusting the amount you want to prepay. You will also be able to see the total interest you can save by prepaying some part of the principal loan amount. ## How is an Online EMI calculator used? You can easily find an EMI calculator online that not only provides instant results but also shows the breakdown between principal repayment and interest amount paid over the loan duration. The calculator can be used to know the estimated installment for all types of credit facilities, such as home, car, or personal loans. To calculate the EMI, you must enter the loan amount, the rate of interest, and the tenure (either in years or months, or both). Once you enter the relevant information, the EMI amount is reflected. Additionally, you will see a pie chart that shows the breakdown in percentage between the principal repayment and the interest amount, which allows you to determine your total interest outflow over the loan duration. ## What are the benefits of using an EMI calculator? Before you avail of a loan, whether secured or unsecured, having an idea of the approximate monthly installment is beneficial. It will not only help you determine if you can afford the loan or not but also allow you to plan your monthly finances to avoid a liquidity crunch. Here are four benefits of using an online loan EMI calculator: 1. With an almost accurate EMI amount, you can plan your finances better and ensure the debt-to-income ratio is below 50% to avoid any stress. 2. You do not have to do the manual calculation to determine the EMI, which reduces your time and effort. 3. The possibility of any errors is completely eliminated as the entire calculation is automated. 4. The calculation is specific for every type of loan, which means the home loan EMI breakdown differs from that of a car loan or a personal loan. 5. ## Frequently asked questions (FAQs) ### What types of loans can you use the EMI calculator for? You can use these online EMI calculators for all types of credit facilities, which include personal, automobile, and home loans. ### What is comprised in the EMI? Some portion of the EMI is used towards the principal repayment and the balance towards the interest. Often, the interest component is higher during the initial period and reduces as you continue making the payments. ### What happens if the interest rate increases or decreases during the loan duration? If your loan is based on a floating interest rate and it decreases during the tenure, a higher portion of the EMI is used towards principal repayment, thereby reducing the loan tenure. In comparison, if the interest rate increases during the loan duration, a higher component is used towards interest, thus marginally impacting its tenure. ### How to use an EMI calculator? To use a calculator, you need to input the loan amount in Rupees, the rate of interest in percentage, and the loan duration in years or months, or both. Using this data, the calculator instantly gives you the total interest and the EMI amount. ### Is the installment amount calculated using the EMI calculator the same as that determined by the lender? When the lender approves your loan application, the exact EMI may vary slightly from the one calculated using an online calculator. The difference may arise due to the actual rate of interest charged by the lender and the processing fees levied. ### Can the EMI amount change over the loan tenure? Lenders offer a floating rate of interest for home and business loans and any change in the interest rate can impact your EMI. Sometimes, the lenders may maintain the same installment amount while adjusting the loan duration. The EMI can also change if you make a partial prepayment on the outstanding loan amount. ### When do you have to pay the EMI after availing of a loan? The lender will provide an EMI schedule at the time of disbursement. The EMI is due on a particular date of the month, which is pre-determined when you receive the loan approval. ### What happens if you do not pay the EMI on time? If you miss an EMI payment on the due date, the lender may levy a late payment fee. Additionally, it is reflected on your credit history and can negatively impact your credit score. ### Is it good to pre-close the loan before the end of its duration? Lenders may charge a prepayment penalty if you repay the entire amount before its due date. Pre-closure may also negatively impact your credit score. However, it is recommended you make partial prepayments whenever you have some extra cash to reduce the total interest outflow. ### What factors affect the EMI amount? Before you avail of a loan, having an idea of the approximate EMI can help you understand the approximate monthly outflow and allow you to plan your finances to avoid any liquidity crunch. The following factors impact the EMI amount. * Loan amount, which is one of the most important factors, and choosing the amount wisely, is advisable. * Interest rate also determines the EMI and the higher the rate, the greater will be the outflow. Therefore, comparing different products offered by various lenders to find the most competitive rate is recommended. * Loan duration, any increase or decrease in the tenure impacts the EMI. The longer the duration the higher will be your interest and total outflow and vice versa. ### Are home, car, and personal loan calculators the same? Most online calculators use the loan amount, rate of interest, and duration to calculate the EMI. However, some calculators may restrict the total loan amount depending on the type of loan you are applying for.

Here\u2019s a 7-Point Easy Guide to Creating an Ideal Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term \u00b7 10 min read ### IN THIS ARTICLE How to Build a Mutual Fund Portfolio? Here\u2019s a 7-Point Guide to Creating an Ideal Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term Mutual funds are an excellent investment option for creating long-term wealth. They will help you meet all your goals, making you financially secure. However, you cannot invest in just one mutual fund to realise your goals. Different goals require different funds, and all these funds put together form a mutual fund portfolio. Although there is no specific rule of thumb to create a mutual fund portfolio for the long term, you can follow a few steps to create one. ## What is a Mutual Fund Portfolio? A mutual fund portfolio is a collection of mutual fund schemes that fit your goals, investment horizon and risk tolerance levels. You can choose to manage your portfolio or take help from a financial advisor who can help manage the portfolio for you. Although there is no ideal mutual fund portfolio that suits everybody, all portfolios must have one thing in common, which is diversification. In other words, it means you must spread your investments across mutual fund schemes across categories to spread the risk of investing. Now that the most important rule of investing is clear let's see how to create an ideal mutual fund portfolio that suits you. ## Strategy to Create a Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term There are no golden rules to creating a portfolio, but the following steps will guide you through creating an ideal mutual fund portfolio for the long term that will suit you the best. ### #1 Identify your goals and resources The first step towards investing is to evaluate your resources and identify your goals. Prepare a financial plan with your income and expenses. See where you can save by cutting down on unnecessary expenses. Only if you can save can you invest. Next, you have to identify your goals. What is the reason for investing, and what goals do you want to achieve by investing? How much will you need to fund your goals? do you want to achieve these goals? Ask yourself these three questions and write down the answers on a piece of paper. Once you answer these questions, you will have your goals, target amount, and investment horizon. Investing without a goal is travelling without a destination. You don't know where you are going. Although that's exciting for some time, in the long term, it can be exhausting. Also, only if you know your target amount and investment horizon will you know how much to start saving today and until when. Hence being aware of one\u2019s goals is very important for any investor to invest in any asset. ### #2 Understand your risk-taking ability Once you've identified your goals, assessing your risk-taking ability is important. Sometimes you think you can stomach the high risk but end up panicking during unfavourable market situations. Hence it is important to understand your risk tolerance level. Factors such as your age, responsibilities, and how you perceive a market correction help determine your risk profile. You can take a risk profiling questionnaire to understand what is your risk-taking capacity. Download a risk profiling questionnaire from the internet for free to understand your risk-taking ability. But why is risk profiling important? You can identify asset classes for your portfolio based on your risk profile. Each asset class has varying levels of risk. For example, equity has the highest risk, and fixed deposits have the least risk. So, depending on your risk-taking ability, you can choose the best investments for your portfolio. ### #3 Determine asset allocation Determining your mutual fund portfolio allocation should be done before you decide where to invest. It is based on the asset allocation that you will determine where and how much you will put your money. There are several types of mutual funds such as equity, debt, and hybrid funds. Within equity, there are several categories, such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, value funds, etc. Each of them falls under different risk levels and gives different returns. Hence it is important to determine your asset allocation before you decide on your investments. You can use different asset allocation strategies, such as the 100 minus age rule or the 80-20 rule. In the 100 minus age rule, you will invest in the percentage of your assets similar to your age in debt and the rest in equity. This is because it is assumed that one can assume more risk at a younger age than when they are old. So, if you are 25 years old, you can invest 25% of your assets in debt and 75% in equity. In the 80-20 rule, you can invest 80% of your assets in equity and 20% in all the other asset classes, such as debt and gold. Each of these strategies has limitations, and it is best to determine your asset allocation strategy based on your goals. For example, for a long-term goal like retirement, you can invest all your assets in equity. For a short-term goal like buying a car, you can invest most of the assets in debt. ### #4 Select funds to invest After determining your mutual fund portfolio allocation, you must pick the funds for your mutual fund portfolio. When selecting funds, ensure your portfolio has a maximum of six to seven funds, as anything more than that can make your portfolio unmanageable. The fund selection must be made meticulously using both quantitative and qualitative parameters. You must check the past performance of the fund to understand the consistency in giving good returns. Then, compare it with the benchmark and peers to see by how much it has outperformed both. Apart from performance, you must check its expense ratio, portfolio turnover ratio and risk-adjusted returns such as Sharpe and Sortino ratio. The fund manager\u2019s expertise and experience also play an important role in the performance of the fund. Use quantitative and qualitative factors to analyse the fund before selecting it as a potential candidate for your portfolio. ### #5 Choose your strategy You can invest in mutual funds in two ways, through SIP (systematic investment plan) or lumpsum. SIP is a facility that allows you to invest a small amount regularly for a period of time. It is best for the salaried class, who receive income monthly. Since you will invest over a period of time, you can benefit from rupee cost averaging, which will reduce your average cost per unit. You can enable auto-debit to ensure you aren\u2019t missing out on your SIP instalment. Additionally, you can step up your SIP amount every year to beat inflation. In lumpsum investment, you will invest a certain amount once in a mutual fund and stay invested until the end of your investment horizon. Lumpsum investment is best when you have a huge sum of money. For example, salaried class bonuses and yearly incentives can be invested through the lump sum route. ### #6 Invest After selecting your funds and deciding your strategy, you must invest to realise your goals. You can invest through offline or online modes. For offline, you can visit the mutual fund office, submit the application form and give a cheque to start your investment journey. However, offline investing is considered time taking in the current era of digitisation. Hence you can consider investing online. You can directly visit the asset management company's website to invest, or you can go to any online platform offering mutual funds, such as Jupiter Money. Online investing is just like online shopping. You have to select the funds you want to invest in, do your digital KYC and submit your bank details, and within no time, you can become a mutual fund investor. through online platforms, you can also see all your investments in one place, helping you to track your progress towards your goals. ### #7 Don\u2019t stop with investing You cannot invest and forget. It is important to monitor your investments regularly to track their progress. Since mutual funds are marketable securities, you must monitor them. Today's best-performing fund might not perform well after a few years affecting your portfolio returns. Hence you must do a yearly review of your portfolio. One easy way to monitor your funds is to track the progress towards your goal. If your portfolio isn\u2019t making enough profits for you to reach your goal, then it's time you rebalance it. Portfolio review and monitoring is a tedious process. You must check the fund's performance, compare it with peers, and benchmark. You must also check the risk-adjusted returns, expense ratio, and whether the fund manager is investing based on the objective or not. Since all this takes time, you can use an online tool such as Jupiter Money\u2019s portfolio analyser tool to check the health of your investments. The tool will tell how your portfolio is performing with respect to the market and also suggest some funds to rebalance it, if necessary. Remember, portfolio monitoring is as important as investing, and you should never neglect it. ## Things to Keep in Mind When Building Your Mutual Fund Portfolio Now that you know how to build a portfolio, here are a few things you must keep in mind before starting your investing journey. **Have an emergency fund:** Before investing for your future, you must set aside money for uncertainties or emergencies. Since you never know when an emergency can knock on your door, it\u2019s better to be prepared. Have an emergency fund with a minimum of 6 months of expenses. Save it in a bank or a liquid fund so you can easily withdraw it when necessary. In an emergency, you can use this fund, and you don't have to put your financial goals on hold. **Understand the market:** Have a basic understanding of the market. Check what investment options are available to you. Within mutual funds, you have a host of options available for different investment goals. Understand how these funds can react when the market goes up or down. You don\u2019t have to dig deep and become a financial expert; a basic understanding is enough. **Do proper research and analysis:** Check which mutual funds suit you best before investing. Select a fund after checking quantitative and qualitative factors. **Don\u2019t hesitate to get help:** If you lack the knowledge and time to do research and select a fund that will help you reach your financial goals, take the help of an expert. Financial advisors will help you invest in the best funds that will best suit your goals and resources. They will also monitor your investments regularly so that you can have a good night's sleep. **Be disciplined and consistent:** The secret behind accumulating wealth is to be consistent with investing. Although SIP helps you inculcate financial discipline, you must do your bit by saving that extra rupee. Cut down on costs wherever possible and invest before you spend. This lets you stay consistent with your investments and reach your financial goals. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### What is a good mutual fund portfolio? A good mutual fund is one that aligns well with your goals, resources, and risk tolerance levels. Selecting mutual funds based on your goals and risk-taking capacity will help you achieve your goals faster and manage your portfolio better. ### How many mutual funds are good in a portfolio? A portfolio should have a maximum of 6-7 funds. Anything more than that will make it difficult to manage and also lead to over-diversification, ultimately harming your portfolio returns. ### What is the minimum time to hold a mutual fund? There is no minimum holding period for mutual funds; you must invest depending on your investment goals and horizon. It is best to stick to your investment until you want to reach your goals. For long-term goals (more than five years), equity mutual funds are the best as they have the potential to give good returns in the long term. Invest in debt mutual funds for short-term goals (one week to three years). ### Which type of mutual fund is best for the long term? Equity mutual funds are the best for long-term investments. This is because they are exposed to market volatility in the short term, which can result in losses. However, the volatility smoothens out in the long term, and equity funds can give high returns. ### What is an ideal mutual fund portfolio? An ideal mutual fund portfolio is one that suits your goals and risk-taking capacity. It must also have a maximum of 6-7 funds to ensure adequate diversification. ### What is 12-20-80 asset allocation? The Quantum mutual fund gave a 12-20-80 asset allocation rule. According to the strategy, you must allocate 12 months of your expenses to liquid funds, 20% of the investable amount in gold funds and 80% to equity. ### How much should I allocate to a mutual fund portfolio? Ideally, you must save and invest 20% of your income. Your portfolio allocation will depend on your goals and risk appetite. Equity is the best for long-term goals and high-risk takers. For short-term goals, debt is the best. Investing 20% in equity and the rest in other assets would be ideal for risk-averse investors. Hence, depending on your needs, you must select your asset allocation.

How To Open A Demat Account? # What Is Demat Account? How To Open A Demat Account? \u00b7 10 min read ### IN THIS ARTICLE It is important to invest to secure your financial future. There are many investment alternatives for you to invest such as shares, mutual funds, and bonds. To invest in these securities, it is important to have a demat account. Read to find out more about a demat account, how to open it and the benefits of having a demat account. ## What is demat account? A demat account also known as dematerialised account is an important requirement in the stock market. It is an account in which you can save your shares and mutual fund purchases. Since a demat account can be accessed from anywhere, you don't have to carry physical shares or mutual fund certificates. Prior to 1996, people used to hold physical share certificates against their share purchases. However, in 1996, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a demat account. Hence all physical shares were converted into digital form/ dematerialised form and stored in 'demat' accounts. Today, physical share certificates are no longer issued. A demat account is necessary to trade in shares and other securities. So, once you purchase the securities, they are reflected in your demat account and remain there until you decide to sell them. ## Why is a demat account needed? A demat account is necessary to trade in securities such as shares and mutual funds. However, it does more than just store your investments. Following are some of the reasons why a demat account is important. * Since it stores securities in digital form, there is no risk of theft or damage. * It eliminates unnecessary paperwork. * Enables quick transfer of shares after a purchase and sale. * Streamlines the process of trading and investing in securities. ## Types of Demat Account There are three different types of demat accounts available in India: regular demat accounts, repatriable demat accounts, and non-repatriable demat accounts. ### Regular demat account A regular demat account, simply known as a demat account, is for all residents of India. This is the most common type of demat account available to investors. It stores your purchase of securities in digital form. When you trade in securities using your trading account, they will get credited or debited from your demat account. However, if you are trading in futures and options (derivatives), you don't need a trading account, as these contracts don't need storage. SEBI has recently introduced a new type of demat account known as basic services demat account to encourage new investors to open a demat account. This account has no maintenance charges if the holding value is below Rs 50,000. If the holding value is between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakhs, the maintenance charges are Rs 100. ### Repatriable demat account Non-resident Indians (NRIs) have the option to invest and trade in Indian securities by opening a repatriable demat account. It allows Indians staying abroad to invest, trade and transfer funds back from India. To have a repatriable demat account, you must have a non-resident ordinary (NRE) bank account. Once you become an NRI, you must close the regular demat account and transfer the shares to a specific demat account known as the NRE demat account. If you want to repatriate the funds back, a repatriation restriction comes into play. As per this restriction, the maximum funds you can transfer in a calendar year (January \u2013 December) is $ 1 million. ### Non-repatriable demat account Non-repatriable demat account is again for NRIs. However, you cannot repatriate the funds abroad once you sell the securities in this demat account. The demat account must be linked to a non-resident ordinary (NRO) account. ## Difference between Demat and Trading account When investing and trading in securities, you must have both demat and trading accounts. Although these accounts have different functions, they are codependent on each other and make trading possible. Let\u2019s look at the differences between these two accounts. * **Functionality:** Demat account helps in storing your investments in digital format. A trading account, on the other hand, helps you buy and sell securities. * **Nature:** The demat account shows the securities you own, whereas the trading account shows the transactions you have done. * **Role:** The roles of trading and demat accounts are different but interrelated. A trading account helps in purchasing and selling securities. In contrast, a demat account takes the delivery of shares. With a demat account, it is impossible to trade in shares and securities. ## Benefits of a Demat Account Following are the benefits of having a demat account. * **No physical certificates:** With a demat account, there is no hassle of storing physical share certificates. Moreover, your investments will not be subject to physical damage as they are stored electronically. * **Easy trading:** Since all your investments are stored in one place, tracking and trading them will be easy. * **Variety of instruments:** Demat account doesn't just store shares. You can also store mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and government securities. Hence with a demat account, you can store, track and monitor all your investments in one place. * **Easy access:** The securities in your demat account can be accessed anywhere and anytime using your smartphone or laptop. It not only makes your investments accessible but also secure. * **Nomination facility:** Demat accounts have a nomination facility. So in case the investor passes away, the nominee will automatically get all the investments, avoiding long procedures and legal disputes. ## How to open a demat account online? Demat accounts are managed by National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL), the two main depositories in India. However, you cannot open a demat account with them. Instead, you must go to a depository participant (DP) to open a demat account. ### Steps to open a demat account You can open a demat account through a depository participant (DP) either online or offline. Below is the step-by-step procedure to open a demat account online. * **Search for a depository participant:** So many depository participants offer different services for demat accounts. Choose a depository participant based on the services they offer and the charges they levy for maintaining the account. You can choose depository participants here from this list on NSDL - <https://nsdl.co.in/dpsch.php> Some of the common names include Zerodha, UpStox, Groww * **Create an account:** Once you select your DP, you must create an account with them by providing all necessary details such as name, date of birth, mobile number, email ID, and PAN card number. You must also provide your bank details so you can get the interest, dividend, and proceeds when you sell your shares. * **Upload documents:** Support all the information you gave above by uploading necessary documents such as a photo, PAN card, Aadhar card, etc. * **Verification:** Once you upload the documents, you must verify your identity. Since it is completely digitised, record a small video of yourself by reading the given script on the screen and uploading it. * **E-sign:** You must digitally sign the documents using your Aadhar-linked mobile number. An OTP will be sent to your phone, and you must enter it to e-sign the application. This method is convenient, secure, and has zero paperwork involved. * **Submit:** Once you e-sign, submit the application, and a demat account will be created shortly after that. You will receive the details of your demat on your email ID and phone. The email will also have your login credentials. ## ## Documents required for opening a demat account SEBI has mandated that any person who wants to open a demat account must have certain documents. Following are documents you will need to open a demat account. * Passport size photo * PAN Card * Proof of identity \u2013 PAN Card, Aadhar Card, Passport, Voter ID * Proof of address \u2013 Aadhar Card, utility bills, driving license, * Bank statement and cancelled cheque * IT return or pay slip if you want to trade in derivatives ## Types of fees and charges associated with opening a Demat Account To open and maintain a demat account, depository participants charge various fees. The fees vary across stock brokers. Hence it is important to choose the one with low fees. However, along with fees, you must also compare the benefits they offer and choose the one giving the maximum services at a low cost. Following are the charges demat account holders pay in general. * **Account opening fee:** It is a one-time fee charged by stock brokers at the time of opening a demat account. Sometimes, the fee is waived to encourage new investors to open a demat account. * **Annual maintenance fee:** It is a recurring fee charged by DPs to maintain your demat account. The maintenance fee varies based on the holding value and transactions you make yearly. * **Transaction fee:** DPs charge you a transaction fee every time you purchase or sell securities. Some DPs charge you on a monthly basis, while some charge per transaction. * **Demat account safety charges:** To ensure your securities are safe in demat form, DPs charge a safety charge. It is levied every month based on International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). * **Pledging fee:** It is a fee charged for pledging securities in your demat account. * **Unpledging fee:** It is a fee charged to unpledged your pledged securities. * **Dematerialisation fee:** A dematerialisation fee is charged when you want to convert your physical shares into the dematerialised format. ## How to reduce demat charges? Demat charges mentioned above are quite normal for any active trader. However, if you aren\u2019t an active trader, you can reduce your demat charges by opening a basic service demat account. This type of demat account has zero maintenance fee. However, the maximum holding limit for availing of the zero-maintenance fee benefit is Rs 2 lakhs. If you are an active trader, you can reduce your demat charges by opting for discount brokerage plans offered by DPs. Such plans offer a flat fee for brokerage services or have reduced transaction fees. Hence active traders can save a lot by opting for such plans. ## Link Bank account to Demat account To trade and invest in securities, it is important to link your demat account with your bank account. Most of the time, banks offer a three-in-one account which has demat, trading and bank account linked together. However, sometimes, many investors end up taking a demat and trading account from a depository participant due to low expenses and convenience. In such cases, linking your bank account with your demat and trading account is necessary. Below are some of the ways to link your bank account with your demat account. * **Through a payment gateway:** You can add funds through a payment gateway offered by banks. You can use either a debit card or a net banking facility to do so. Some banks charge a nominal fee for using their payment gateway. Hence consider these charges before opting for this method. * **Through NEFT/RTGS:** To add funds to your demat and trading account through NEFT or RTGS, you must add your demat account as a beneficiary in your net banking portal. After the beneficiary gets added, you can transfer funds whenever you need. * **Through UPI:** UPI is the most convenient way to add money to your demat and trading account. All you have to do is select UPI while adding funds to your demat account. The funds are reflected almost immediately in your demat or trading account. ## How to invest in mutual funds without a demat account? No, you don\u2019t require a demat account to invest in mutual funds. Below are some of the ways you can invest in mutual funds without a demat account. * **Through asset management company (AMC):** You can invest in mutual funds directly through a fund house or asset management company. AMCs have their own websites, or you can also visit a branch personally. If you invest directly through this method, you can only invest in the funds of that AMC. Moreover, there won't be any periodic portfolio review, and you won't be able to track all your mutual funds in one place if you invest. * **Offline distributors:** There are many offline distributors who help you invest in mutual funds. They suggest funds as per your goals and do all your paperwork. However, you won't be able to track your funds in real-time as you have to rely on these distributors. Hence it is better to invest online through mutual fund platforms. * **Online platforms:** There are many online platforms that offer direct and regular mutual funds. They also suggest funds from different fund houses based on your goal and investment horizon. Moreover, these platforms do periodic portfolio reviews ensuring your portfolio is progressing towards your goal. ## Demat accounts for minors A demat account can be opened in the name of minors. However, the account will be operated by a guardian until the minor attains majority. The guardian can be a father, mother, or any person appointed by the court. ## Free demat account with no annual charges Many depository participants offer free demat accounts with no annual charges. Moreover, they also waive account opening charges to encourage aspiring investors. However, they do charge a brokerage fee which is fixed regardless of the trade value. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### 1\\. Do you need a demat account to invest in mutual funds?

It is a long-term investment product managed by the Central Government, making it a safe choice for everyone. It has a 15-year lock-in period that allows your money to grow into significant wealth over the long run. It is mainly popular due to risk-free returns and tax benefits. The invested amount and the maturity benefit of PPF both are tax-exempted, making it an attractive option. You can put a minimum of \u20b9500 and a maximum of \u20b91.5 lakhs in the PPF account during a financial year. Moreover, the current rate of interest offered on PPF is 7.1%. However, before investing in this instrument, it is advisable to use a PPF calculator online and get a clear idea about the expected returns. This article covers everything you must know about the calculator. ## What Is PPF Calculator? To calculate the potential return from a PPF, you must consider various factors. Determine how frequently you want to invest, how much you can deposit in the account, and if you wish to stay invested after the lock-in period. All these aspects can make the calculation rather tricky and time-consuming. And this is when the PPF calculator comes to your rescue. The rate of interest on PPF is periodically determined by the Central Government. The calculator considers the rate of interest prevalent at the time of investment and provides you with the result accordingly. In simple words, it is a tool that will tell you how much profit you can generate by investing in PPF. ## How the PPF Calculator Can Help You? PPF can be confusing, especially for first-time investors. The calculator makes it easy for everyone to keep an eye on their account balance and growth. It can also help resolve your queries about the changing interest rates or how they affect your maturity value. The tool accurately calculates your potential profit and shows you the data within seconds. The best thing is that you only need to provide some basic information such as deposit amount, investment frequency, and tenure. Thereafter, you can automatically see the current PPF interest rate on the calculator. This makes the calculations quick and easy for you. ## Formula and procedure used for calculating the PPF interest PPF offers compound interest, which is calculated on the available balance annually. The formula has different components: F: Maturity benefit P: Annual installments n: Number of years i: Interest rate/100 The PPF formula: F = P x Let us understand this with an example. Suppose you invest \u20b91 lakh to the account every year for 15 years, and the rate of interest is 7.1%. Using the above formula, your estimated maturity amount is: 1 lakh x = \u20b931,17,276. ## How to use PPF Calculator? The latest PPF calculator 2020-21 is easy to use. Check out the below instructions to get the result quickly. 1\\. Frequency of Investment This is generally the first step to follow. There are 4 options under this section: Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, and Yearly. You may choose one based on how often you want to invest in the PPF account in a financial year. 2\\. Deposit Amount Under this option, you must enter your preferred investment amount for the payment frequency you chose earlier. You may invest up to \u20b91.5 lakhs a year. 3\\. Current PPF Balance This section is for those who already have an accumulated balance in the PPF account. If you are investing for the first time, leave it blank, it will show \u20b90. Otherwise, mention the balance amount you have. 4\\. Duration of Investment You will find a slider under this section that ranges from 15 years to 70 years. You can adjust it depending on your preferred investment term. After selecting the tenure, the calculator will automatically determine the estimated returns based on your inputs and the current rate of interest offered by the government. On the left side of the calculator, you will find the amounts for the total investment made, total interest earned, and the maturity value. ### How PPF is Calculated? The return on your account balance is calculated monthly based on the interest rate offered in that quarter. But the PPF credits the interest earned during a financial year only when the year ends. For the monthly calculation, the lowest amount recorded in your account from the 5th day of a month to the last day of that month is considered. Suppose your PPF balance on 1st April 2021 is \u20b910,000, and you deposit another \u20b930,000 on 3rd April 2021. In this scenario, the interest will be calculated on \u20b940,000. But, if you deposit \u20b930,000 on 6th April 2021, the interest will be calculated only on \u20b910,000. Also, PPF offers compound interest on your balance. So, at the end of each year, the interest is calculated on your total balance (principal amount and the interest already earned). Moreover, you may remain invested in the PPF after the lock-in period even without making additional deposits. You will still receive annually compounded returns on the balance amount. ## Advantages of PPF Calculator The calculator serves many purposes, making it a helpful tool for both new and experienced investors.

When you provide the required information, it shows the return you can expect at the end of 15 years. You can make investment decisions based on that. 3\\. Can be used multiple times There is no limit to how many times you can use the PPF account calculator. So, you can try out different investment amounts and frequencies multiple times. This way, you will be able to figure out how much to invest to get your desired return. 4\\.

However, it is paid only to those employees who have completed at least five years of service for a particular company. However, an employee is eligible for gratuity before completing at least five years of services if he or she is disabled due to an ailment or an accidental injury. This employee benefit is regulated by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The amount depends on the employee\u2019s last drawn monthly salary and the number of years completed working with the particular company.

The gratuity calculator is a handy tool to calculate the amount you will receive on leaving the company. ## How to Calculate Gratuity? The gratuity amount primarily depends on two factors, which include your last drawn salary (basic + dearness allowance) and the total number of years in service for the company. The law does not stipulate any specific percentage for employees to receive this benefit at the time of leaving or retiring from the company. Employers can adopt a formula-based approach to determine the amount or pay higher than this amount. ## What Is Gratuity Formula? The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 classifies employees in two categories, which include the following. * Personnel covered under the Act * Employees not covered under the Act Any company that employs 10 or more employees in one month for the last 12 months is required to cover all its personnel under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the number of employees reduces below 10, the company is still liable to pay gratuity to the remaining personnel. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 covers people employed in mines, factories, plantations, ports, and companies employing more than 10 people. Unlike , the employees do not contribute towards gratuity and the entire amount is paid by the companies. Employers can opt for a group gratuity plan from a reliable insurance service provider wherein the company makes annual contributions to this plan. The gratuity formula varies on whether you are covered or not covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity formula included in the gratuity calculator for covered employees is Gratuity Amount = last drawn salary * employment duration * 15/26 * The number of working days in a month is considered 26 * The gratuity amount calculation is based on the earnings for 15 days * The last drawn salary should include the basic income, (for government employees), and sales commissions (if any) If you have completed 11 years in your company and your last drawn salary including DA is INR 65,000, the gratuity amount is Amount = 65,000 * 11 * 15/26 = INR 4,12,500 If you are not covered by the act, here is how to calculate gratuity amount: Amount = last drawn salary * employment duration * 15/30 In the example above, the gratuity amount comes to INR 3,57,500 ## How Can Gratuity Calculator Help You? If you have worked for the same company for at least five years and are near the age of superannuation, you are eligible to receive gratuity. An online gratuity calculator can help you in the following ways. * Determine the approximate amount due * Plan your long-term finances * Save your time and reduce your efforts * Use it from any place any time as per your convenience ## How to use Jupiter's Gratuity Calculator?

If you work for a private sector company, the lowest amount from the following is tax-free only if your employer is covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. * Eligible gratuity amount * INR 20 lakhs * The actual gratuity amount received The maximum amount of gratuity you can claim as tax-exempt cannot exceed INR 20 lakhs during your entire working life.

However, when we talk about the long term, it doesn't mean you invest and forget. Since mutual funds are marketable securities, they are exposed to market risks and thus require constant monitoring. You must review your mutual fund portfolio often to ensure your investments are giving good returns. ## How to evaluate the performance of mutual funds? You can check the performance of your mutual funds through the following ways. **#1 Link your investment with your goal:** your goals with your investment, you can track the progress of your investments. Estimate the money needed for your goal, and see whether your investments are helping you progress towards your goal. If not, then it's time you rethink your investment in that fund. **#2 Compare with the benchmark performance:** You can also check whether your fund is performing well or not by comparing it with its benchmark. A fund's benchmark is usually disclosed in the scheme information document. the fund's returns and the benchmark, you can check whether your fund is underperforming or beating the benchmark. **#3 Compare with similar funds:** There are several mutual fund houses, each of which has funds for different categories. So, pick up funds of a similar category from other asset management companies (AMC) and compare your fund's returns with them. If your fund is underperforming, then it's time you switch your investment from underperforming to a better one. **#4 Check historical performance:** Although a mutual fund's past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, it is important to check the fund's past performance. Check how the fund has performed in different cycles, and look for consistency in returns. Consistency helps understand the expertise and skill of the fund manager. **#5 Check the expense ratio:** The expense ratio of the fund is important while assessing the performance of a fund. Although a high expense ratio means lower returns, a fund with a high expense ratio can sometimes perform extremely well, as the manager might need additional funds for quick decision-making to capitalize on an opportunity. **#6 Evaluate the risk-adjusted returns:** Mutual funds come with a risk that is difficult to eliminate. However, checking whether the returns justify the risk is important. Several ratios, such as alpha, Sharpe, and information ratios, can be used to measure risk-adjusted returns. Evaluating the performance of the mutual fund isn't rocket science. However, it is a time taking process. Imagine the amount of time you have to spend to compare the performance of the fund with its benchmark or peers and estimate the risk-adjusted returns!

With Jupiter's portfolio analyser tool, evaluating your mutual fund portfolio has become easier than ever and will hardly take any time. ## Different types of \u2018Returns\u2019 in mutual fund A mutual fund's performance is evaluated based on returns. Though mathematically, there is only one way to estimate the profit; there are several kinds of returns that you can use to analyse your mutual funds. Below are the different types of mutual returns. **Absolute returns \u2013** It is the simplest form of return and tells by how much the investment has grown, irrespective of the time period. **Annualised returns \u2013** Also known as CAGR (compound annual growth rate), this return is the average annual return of a mutual fund estimated over a period of time. **Total return \u2013** The actual return you make from an investment is the total return. It considers dividends, interest, and capital gains for calculating the return from a mutual fund. **Point-to-point return \u2013** It is the return from a mutual fund between two time periods. To calculate it, you must have start and end dates. **Trailing return \u2013** Return from mutual funds over a period of time until the current date is trailing return. it takes into account the volatility in the net asset value (NAV) over a period of time and not just the initial and final NAV. **Rolling returns \u2013** The average annual return of a fund over a short period of time is rolling returns. It helps identify the fund\u2019s strong and poor performance in a period of time. **Extended internal rate of return (XIRR) \u2013** XIRR estimates the returns from SIP (systematic investment plan). It measures the return from a mutual fund when multiple transactions are involved at different time periods. XIRR is usually calculated in Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers or Google Sheets, as it is difficult to calculate it manually. ## Financial ratios to evaluate mutual funds **Alpha:** It measures how much has the mutual fund outperformed its benchmark. It is calculated by subtracting the benchmark\u2019s return from the fund return. A positive alpha indicates the fund has outperformed the benchmark, whereas a negative alpha indicates its performance is less than the benchmark. **Beta:** It measures the volatility in the fund relative to the benchmark and is often used as a measure of risk. A beta of one indicates that the fund has a similar risk as the market. If the beta is above one, it means the fund is more volatile than the market, whereas a beta less than one indicates the fund is less volatile. **Portfolio turnover:** It measures how many times the portfolio has been turned over in a year. A high portfolio turnover ratio indicates that the mutual fund holdings have been changed, often leading to high transaction costs. In contrast, a low portfolio turnover ratio indicates lower transaction costs and higher returns. **Sharpe ratio:** It is a measure of a mutual fund\u2019s risk-adjusted returns by comparing the return against the returns of a risk-free asset. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return from the portfolio's return and dividing it by the standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio is considered better. **Sortino ratio:** It is a variation of the Sharpe ratio and measures the risk-adjusted returns against the risk-free asset by considering only the downside standard deviation. A higher Sortino ratio is considered good. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### How to calculate profit percentage in a mutual fund?

You may invest in different asset classes, such as debt, equity, gold, real estate, and others. Furthermore, you may pick from different products within the various asset classes. If you invest in equities, choosing shares of different companies with varying market capitalization and industries is a good way to diversify your portfolio. One of the available options includes index mutual funds. Wondering what are index funds? Read on to know more. ## What are index funds? These are mutual funds that invest the entire corpus to imitate the underlying index like the Sensex or the Nifty. These funds are passively managed and the fund managers invest in the same companies in a similar proportion that is included in the underlying index. Therefore, your returns are in line with the benchmark index. ## Introduction to stock exchange Before proceeding on , let us understand stock exchanges. India has multiple stock exchanges but the two most popular ones include the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). When companies are looking to expand their business, they go to these stock exchanges to raise money from the public. Some companies may be large like Reliance Industries Limited while others may be smaller like Bata. You may choose companies from different sectors and compositions. Stock exchanges have multiple categories to classify these companies to ensure investors are not confused. BSE includes the top 30 Indian companies in its S&P BSE Sensex 30. A broader index is the S&P BSE Sensex 50 comprising the top 50 Indian companies. Other indexes include the S&P BSE MidCap, S&P BSE SmallCap, S&P BSE Capital Goods, S&P BSE Healthcare, and much more. Similarly, there are various NSE indexes, such as the Nifty 50, Nifty 100, and others. You can visit the BSE and NSE websites to find a list of all these indexes. ## How do index funds work? While investing in these funds, you should choose from several options. Generally, most people invest in either the Nifty 50 index fund or the Sensex. Fund managers copy the composition of the benchmark index to match its performance. However, there may be a small difference between the fund performance and index due to tracking error. It is because the fund manager may not be able to buy and sell the stocks in the same proportion as comprised in the benchmark index. ## How to invest in index funds? ### Offline investing You can visit the closest branch of the asset management company (AMC) along with the following documents: * Know-your-customer (KYC) documents * Identity proof * Permanent Account Number (PAN) card copy * Passport-sized photographs * Canceled check ### Investing through brokers You can also invest in different funds like the Nifty MidCap Index or SmallCap Index schemes via a broker. ### Online investing You may invest online via a reliable portal that allows you to compare different funds. In addition to reducing your efforts, investing via an online portal eliminates commission or fees paid to the broker. Once you evaluate different options, you may select the fund and estimate the future returns via an online calculator to make an informed decision. Check out this article, to understand things to consider before investing in Index funds. ## Who should invest in index funds? * Investors with a longer investment horizon * Those who do not want to constantly monitor and modify their mutual fund portfolio * Individuals who have a low risk appetite but want to earn returns that are more than fixed-income products ## Why should you invest in index funds? ### Lower expense ratio Schemes like the Nifty index funds are passively managed, which means they involve less research and the team required to make investment decisions is small. Therefore, the total expense ratio (TER) is lower when compared to actively managed funds. An actively managed fund can have a TER between 1% and 2% percent whereas the TER of index schemes is between 0.2% and 0.5%. Although this may seem a small difference, the actual effect on your long-term net returns could be significant. ### Lesser efforts Like most people, even you may not like the idea of selecting an active fund because it requires a lot of research. Generally, you may invest in active funds based on their one-year performance and constantly change your portfolio based on this parameter. As a result, you may end up with several mutual funds and earn returns similar to the index funds. Therefore, to save your time and efforts, putting money in index mutual funds is advisable. ## Active funds vs. passive index funds As the name suggests, active funds are actively managed by the fund managers. It means the fund managers and their teams conduct extensive research and decide on which stocks to buy and sell. On the other hand, passive funds copy the stock composition of the underlying benchmark index, reducing the efforts of the fund managers. ## Things to Consider Before Investing in Index Funds Investing in index mutual funds may be less risky than large-cap funds. However, it is not completely risk-free. Before you invest in one of the several available options, here are four things to consider. ### Time To maximize your returns, it is recommended you invest in index funds for a longer period. It is advisable to hold your investment for at least five years to maximize the gains. And if you hold the funds for seven years, it can be more beneficial. A longer holding period ensures your investment can tide through the short-term market volatility. Since the recommended investment horizon is longer, you must not invest your contingency savings in these types of mutual funds. ### Index category There are several categories of index funds in India. Although there are a large number of indices on the stock exchange, index funds are available only for some of these. So, if you choose funds like Tata Index Sensex Fund, LIC MF Index Sensex Fund, or Nippon India Index Fund \u2013 Sensex Plan, you are primarily investing in the top 30 companies in India. Alternatively, if you want to invest in the top 50 Indian companies, you may choose funds that track the Nifty 50. Within this category, you can either opt for Nifty 50 Equal Weight or Nifty 50 Index. The investee companies in both these types of funds are the same but there is still a minor difference. If you choose the Nifty 50 Index, some of the investee companies get more weightage while the others have a smaller weightage. On the other hand, if you opt for Nifty 50 Equal Weightage, all the investee companies have the same weightage. The concentrated portfolio of the Nifty 50 funds carries a slightly higher risk when compared to the equally distributed portfolio of the Nifty 50 Equal Weightage Index funds. You can make the decision based on your risk appetite. ### Tracking error and expense ratio Some of the best index funds have lower tracking error and expense ratios. Tracking error is primarily the deviation of the fund's performance when compared to the returns delivered by the underlying benchmark index. This error arises because even though the fund managers try their best to mimic the index, there is some difference between the two. The expense ratio includes expenses like administrative costs and the lower the ratio, the higher will be your actual returns. Compared to actively managed mutual funds, the expense ratio for index funds is lower. This is because the fund managers do not need to actively analyze various stocks and make investment decisions, which reduces the time and size of the research team. ## Top-performing index funds in India While analyzing the performance of funds, you need to consider several parameters. As of 7th September 2021, the five top-performing index funds are listed below: **Fund Name** | **Five-year returns (%)** | **Three-year returns (%)** ---|---|--- Nippon India Index Fund Direct Plan \u2013 Growth | 15.95 | 16.03 Tata Index Fund Direct Plan | 15.83 | 15.93 ICICI Prudential Sensex Index Fund Direct Plan \u2013 Growth | NA | 15.93 IDFC Nifty Fund Direct Plan \u2013 Growth | 15.34 | 15.85 HDFC Index Fund \u2013 Sensex Plan \u2013 Direct Plan \u2013 Growth | 16.25 | 15.78 ## Frequently asked questions (FAQs) ### Is investing in index funds risky? All investments have some risk; however, investing in these funds for the long term ensures you mitigate the risks and earn stable returns. ### Are there any fees while investing in index funds? AMCs charge a small percent of the total value of your investment as an expense ratio; however, it is a minimal cost and varies across different funds. ### Where can you buy index funds? You can either buy these funds directly from the AMCs\u2019 websites or via online portals. Alternatively, you may purchase these from the closest branch of the fund house. ### What\u2019s the difference between Index funds and ETFs? Index funds are like mutual fund schemes wherein the fund managers mirror the holding based on the underlying benchmark. However, you can buy these funds only at their net asset value (NAV) determined at the end of the day. In comparison, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are listed on the stock exchanges. Therefore, you can buy or sell these at any point during trading hours. ETFs have a higher expense ratio due to trading costs like brokerage and Securities Transaction Tax (STT). Because index mutual funds are not traded and are passively managed, the expense ratio is comparatively lower than ETFs. ### How are index funds taxed? These funds are types of equity schemes and are taxed as other equity plans. The dividends are included in your income and taxed at your prevalent tax slab. If you redeem the units within 12 months, the gains are considered as short-term capital gains (STCG)and taxed at 15% plus cess as applicable. However, if your holding period is more than one year, the long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to INR 1 lakh are tax-exempt and profits exceeding this limit are taxed at 10% plus cess as applicable without indexation.

Though both plans have the same portfolio, they have different net asset values (NAV) and returns. Following are the major differences between direct and regular mutual funds. ### Meaning As mentioned above, direct funds do not involve a distributor. You invest directly with the AMC (asset management company) without a financial advisor. You are required to pick mutual funds on your own for your portfolio. In contrast, in a regular plan, you invest through a distributor, who is also an advisor. They will help you choose the best funds based on your goals. ### Total Expense Ratio (TER) Since you are investing on your own in direct plans, you don't have to pay any commissions, which will reduce the fund's total expense ratio. In the case of regular funds, the expense ratio will be slightly higher as it includes the commissions you must pay the advisor. ### Net Asset Value (NAV) The net asset value of a fund is the market value of the underlying securities of the scheme. The total expense ratio of a mutual fund is adjusted from the NAV. Since the expense is deducted from the NAV, the NAV for direct plans is slightly higher than regular plans. As a result, the returns will also be higher for direct funds. ### Control You have full control over your mutual fund portfolio in direct mutual funds. However, with control comes responsibility, and you must put in some effort to study mutual funds and manage your investments. Updating KYC (Know Your Customer), monitoring investments regularly, and other procedural tasks must be done independently. But a little effort can help you make higher returns in the long run. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### Which direct mutual fund app is best? Several apps offer direct mutual funds. Check for the additional services they offer apart from offering direct mutual funds, and choose the one you are comfortable with. Some of the best apps to invest in mutual funds are Jupiter Money, Groww, ET Money, MyCams, KFinKart, Coin By Zerodha, Paytm Money Mutual Funds App, Cash Rich and Kuvera. ### How can I buy direct mutual funds? You can buy direct mutual funds from the AMC directly, or you can buy them through investment platforms that offer direct mutual funds, such as Jupiter or Groww. ### Is it better to buy mutual funds directly? Investing in direct mutual funds has several benefits over regular mutual funds. Their expense ratio is low, and the returns are also higher. However, you will have to do some homework and put in some effort to manage your investments. ### Is Groww a direct mutual fund?

The making charges can be between 5% and 23% depending on the type of jewellery and the jewellery you choose. ### Gold bars and coins Buying gold in bars or coins does not have usage value and is also liable to making charges. However, these are lower when compared to the making charges levied on jewellery. Further, investing in the physical form whether as jewellery, bars, or coins carries the risk of damage or theft. ### Gold savings schemes These gold schemes are offered by jewellers wherein you invest a particular amount at regular intervals (generally monthly). At the end of the investment period, you can buy jewellery totaling your invested amount. Some jewellers may add a bonus amount to your investment, allowing you to buy jewellery of a higher sum. While putting money in such gold investment schemes, you need to conduct a thorough background check of the jewellers to ensure security.

These bonds are denominated in grams and the basic unit is one gram. You may invest a maximum of up to four kilograms in these bonds. Sovereign bonds have a maturity period of eight years; however, exits are allowed from the fifth year. These bonds are one of the best ways to invest in gold if you do not want to hold it in its physical form. ## Documents required for investing in gold If you want to put more than INR 2 lakhs in physical gold, you will need a copy of your Permanent Account Number (PAN) card.

If you are a risk-averse investor, you may look for high liquidity, security, and returns. Gold offers investment security and liquidity and can also deliver relatively good returns. Here are two reasons why you should invest in gold. 1. The precious metal offers inflation-beating returns, and in the long term, gold investment returns are in line with the inflationary increase. 2. The performances of gold and equity markets are inversely related, which means if the stock prices fall, there may be a rise in the value of gold, and this can help balance the overall performance of your investment portfolio. ### How do I invest in gold via mutual funds? You can invest in gold ETFs or gold funds either offline or online directly with any mutual fund house. Alternatively, you may invest in gold mutual funds via a registered distributor. Moreover, investments in gold funds can be done via systematic investment plans (SIPs). When you choose an SIP, you can put even INR 500 at periodic intervals in your chosen schemes. You can also invest in gold mutual funds through online portals. ### Why should you consider gold purchase online?

TDS on salary is deducted by the employers on your taxable earnings. Moreover, ensures the government collects the income tax from the source itself. ## What is section 192 of Income Tax Act? Section 192 of Income Tax Act, 1961 relates to TDS on salary earnings. Your employer deducts the applicable TDS from your salary. The company is responsible to deduct the accurate TDS based on your taxable income and tax rate for the relevant financial year. Your employer provides Form 16, which shows the TDS deducted after the end of the financial year. ## Who can deduct TDS under section 192? As per the provisions of Sec 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, employers must deduct the applicable TDS. Employers include the following. * Individuals * Local authorities * Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) * Association of Persons (AOPs) or Body of Individuals (BOIs) * Partnership firms * Co-operative societies * Trusts * Companies (public and private) * Every artificial judicial person. The presence of an employer-employee relationship is mandatory as per the provisions of this section. However, the employer status and the number of employees do not matter while calculating and deducting the applicable TDS. ## When is TDS deducted under section 192? Employers must deduct the TDS and deposit it into the government account. As per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, employers must deduct the TDS when the salary is paid and not when it accrues. Moreover, TDS is deducted if your employer pays an or if you receive past arrears. Further, the employer must deduct TDS on salary even if the employee does not provide their Permanent Account Number (PAN) details and the income from salary exceeds the basic exemption limit. If your estimated salary income is less than the basic exemption limit, the employer will not deduct TDS. The following are the exemption limits when TDS is not applicable. * Indian residents who are less than 60 years: INR 2.50 lakhs * Senior citizens between 60 and 80 years: INR 3 lakhs * Super senior citizens who are over 80 years old: INR 5 lakhs ## What is the rate of tax deduction under section 192? As per the provisions of section 192, TDS is deducted as per your income tax slab and the applicable rates relevant to the financial year. The employer calculates the taxable income after considering the various exemptions and deductions available as per the various sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS is then deducted as per the income tax slab rate. Your employer calculates the estimated tax at the start of the financial year. The TDS is then determined by dividing the approximate tax liability for the year by 12 (based on the assumption that you will continue working in the company for the entire duration during the financial year). Moreover, if you do not provide your PAN details, your employer will deduct TDS at the rate of 20%. Any deficit or excess due to earlier deductions can be adjusted by enhancing or reducing the subsequent deductions during the remaining period of the financial year. If you have paid any advance tax, it can be also adjusted against the TDS. Furthermore, you must inform your employer at the beginning of the financial year if you will continue with the old tax regime or opt for the new tax regime. If you select the latter, it ensures your employer calculates and deducts the accurate TDS as per the new regime. ## What is section 192A and why is TDS important? Section 192A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 covers TDS on withdrawals made from provident funds. If the PAN card is submitted, TDS is at 10%; however, if you submit Form 15G or Form 15H, TDS is not deducted. Employers calculate the estimated tax liability at the start of the financial year based on your salary and other factors. The TDS is then deducted each month from your salary and deposited in the government account. This helps the government collect the tax from the source directly and reduces the chance of any missed payments. TDS is deducted from your salary every month when it is paid. This helps in budgeting since you know the exact amount you will receive in hand, which enables you to plan your finances well. Additionally, a proportionate amount is deducted each month, thus, you do not have to pay a huge lump sum at the end of the financial year. Therefore, your burden is reduced and regular deductions ensure you do not face any liquidity crunch at the end of the year. ## How to calculate TDS on salary? To calculate TDS on salary, the following points need to be considered. * If you provide details from other earnings like rental income, your employer will include it in the TDS calculation. * If you submit Form 12BB, interest on a home loan of up to INR 2 lakhs paid during the year is deducted from your salary. * If you invest in any tax-saving products, you must provide proof of such investments, which reduces your taxable income and the applicable TDS. Here is an example for understanding the calculation. Assume that your annual salary is INR 12 lakhs. The TDS estimation is as follows: Annual salary| 12,00,000 ---|--- Less: Standard deduction| 50,000 Gross total income| 11,50,000 Less: Chapter VI A deductions (Section 80C)| 1,50,000 Total taxable income| 10,00,000 Tax liability| 1,17,000 TDS per month| 9,750 However, if you opt for the new tax regime, the tax liability is INR 119,800 and the monthly TDS will be INR 9,983. ## How is TDS deducted in the case of two or more employers? ### Job change during the financial year You may change your job during the financial year, which means you will earn a salary from two employers. In this case, you must submit Form 12B to your new employer to ensure they deduct the appropriate TDS. The new company considers the TDS deducted by your previous employer to determine the amount for the remaining period during the year. ### Employed with two or more companies simultaneously If you work with more than one company simultaneously during the financial year, you must submit Form 12B to any one employer. And one of the companies must then deduct the applicable TDS payable on the total salaries received from all employers. ### The standard deduction for salaried employees in income tax The standard deduction available to salaried individuals has been increased to INR 50,000 per year, which reduces their taxable income. However, the higher standard deduction replaces the medical reimbursement and transport allowance benefits that were previously available. ### TDS calculation in case salary is payable in foreign currency The foreign currency salary is converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate as on the last day of the preceding month when salary is due or is paid in advance, or . For example, if the salary is paid in January 2022, the exchange rate as of 31st December 2021 is used. Once the foreign salary is converted to Indian Rupees, the standard procedure to determine the TDS is followed. ## What is the time limit to deposit tax under section 192? Employers must deposit the TDS with the government within a specified time limit, which is as follows: * Amount deducted between April and February of the financial year: 7th of the subsequent month * Amount deducted for March: on or before 30th April ## Difference between section 194A and section 192 Section 194A relates to the provisions of TDS on interest other than that on securities. TDS under this section has to be deducted if interest is paid to a resident. These provisions do not apply to interest paid to non-residents, which is governed by section 195. On the other hand, section 192 relates to the TDS deducted by employers on the salary paid to the employees at the time of payment. TDS is deducted even if the salary is paid in advance or as arrears. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### What is section 192 of Income Tax Act? Employers deduct TDS on salary paid to employees as per the provisions of this section of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ### Is TDS deducted every month? According to the rules, TDS is deducted when salary is paid. Therefore, it is deducted every month if your salary income exceeds the basic exemption limit. ### How many types of TDS certificates are there? TDS certificates are of two types, which include Form 16 and Form 16A. The former is issued by the employers and reflects the TDS deductions made during the year. The latter shows TDS deductions on income other than salary. ### How is TDS on salary determined? There is no specific rate at which TDS is calculated.

You may often look for different options to determine the returns offered by various investment products. However, you may not know that these earnings are nominal returns and not the actual money you will receive in your pocket. Well, your return on investment is affected by inflation and taxes. Read on to know more. ## What Is Inflation? You may have heard this term frequently but do you know ? In simple terms, inflation means the rising living cost over a period or the lower value of money. It is the general increase in the price of goods and services over the years, which decreases your purchasing power. For example, the price of a movie ticket five years ago was significantly lower than what it is today. So, if the inflation rate is 2% and the movie ticket costs INR 100 today, its price one year later will be INR 102. ### What Is Inflation Rate? The retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reduced to 5.59% in July 2021 against one year ago when it was recorded as 6.69% in August 2020. The current inflation rate in India is between 2% and 6%, which is within the range of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). ### Types of Inflation Inflation is a quantitative measure of changes in prices of goods and services over a period and is denoted as a percent. As inflation increases, the purchasing power decreases and vice versa. Here are the 3 types of inflation. 1. **Demand-pull inflation:** It results when the demand for the goods and services exceeds their supply, and this difference results in a price increase. 2. **Cost-push inflation:** It is the result of the increase in production costs due to rising input prices like those of labor and raw materials. 3. **Built-in inflation:** It is the effect of future expectations; higher prices result in more wages, which offer better living standards, thereby continuing the cycle ## Inflation Effect on Investment The effects of inflation are not limited to lower purchasing power. It may result in the demand for higher wages to meet rising prices, which may mean more unemployment due to lay-offs. High inflation can also weaken the country\u2019s currency and make domestic products less competitive in the global markets. ## What Is Nominal Rate of Return? When you invest in any asset class, the potential returns are always nominal as these are calculated before tax and inflation. The nominal rate of return is the profit on your investments before considering factors like inflation, investment fees, and taxes. Therefore, when you say that your investment returns are 10%, it actually means the nominal return is 10%. Comparing nominal returns of different asset classes helps you make the right investment decision as tax implications for every financial instrument may vary. ### Nominal Rate of Return Calculation The formula to calculate nominal return is as follows: (End Value \u2013 Begin Value) / Begin Value Let us understand this with an example, assume that you invested INR 10 lakh one year ago and its value today is INR 11 lakh, the nominal return is as follows: (1100000 \u2013 1000000)/1000000 = 100000, which is 10% returns on your initial investment ## What Is After-Tax Real Rate of Return? The post-tax earnings are the returns after adjusting for the tax implications on the profits. Generally, the tax implications vary from one asset class to another and are also dependent on the investment horizon, age, and income tax slab. ### After-Tax Real Rate of Return Calculation The after-tax real rate of return is calculated as Nominal Rate of Return x (1 \u2013 Tax Rate) Let us take the above example, where the nominal rate of return was 10%. Now assume that the applicable tax rate is 20%. The after-tax returns will be 10% x (1 \u2013 20%) = 8% ## What Is Tax Rate? It is the rate at which the tax liability is calculated on your income. Below are the tax rates for individuals as per the old and new tax regime: **Tax slab** | **Tax rate: old regime** | **Tax rate: new regime** ---|---|--- Up to INR 2.50 lakhs | Nil | Nil INR 2.50 lakhs \u2013 INR 5 lakhs | 5% of income exceeding INR 2.50 lakhs + 4% cess | 5% of income exceeding INR 2.50 lakhs INR 5 lakhs \u2013 INR 7.50 lakhs | 20% of income exceeding INR 5 lakhs + INR 12500 + 4% cess | 10% of income exceeding INR 5 lakhs + INR 12500 INR 7.50 lakhs \u2013 INR 10 lakhs | 15% of income exceeding INR 7.50 lakhs + INR 37500 INR 10 lakhs \u2013 INR 12.50 lakhs | 30% of income exceeding INR 10 lakhs + INR 112500 + 4% cess | 20% of income exceeding INR 10 lakhs + INR 75000 INR 12.50 lakhs \u2013 INR 15 lakhs | 25% of income exceeding INR 12.50 lakhs + INR 125000 Exceeding INR 15 lakhs | 30% of income exceeding INR 15 lakhs + INR 187500 ### What Is Cess? Do you know what is cess? A cess is a tax levied by the government on taxes for specific purposes until the authorities receive the required funds to meet their purpose. It is different from the regular tax levied on your income and is a tax on the tax. The regular tax collected by the department is retained in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) and can be used for any purpose as required. On the other hand, the revenues collected as cess are first credited to the CFI and after the appropriation from the Parliament, the government may use it for its deemed purpose. Another difference between regular tax and cess is that the former is shared with the state governments while the latter may or may not be shared with the state governments. The various types of cess on income tax that may be levied by the government include education, health, clean energy, Krishi Kalyan, and Swachh Bharat cesses. ### How to Calculate Post-Tax Returns? The post-tax returns on investments are calculated after considering the implication of cess on the actual tax. For example, if the cess is levied at 4%, then the post-tax return calculation is as follows: Nominal Return = INR 100000 Tax @ 20% = 100000 x 20% = INR 20000 Cess @ 4% = 20000 x 4% = INR 8000 Post-tax returns = 100000 \u2013 20000 \u2013 800 = INR 79200, which is 7.92% ### What Is Real Rate of Return? As discussed above, inflation erodes the value of money. Therefore, the value of INR 1 lakh today is not the same as it was one year ago. To know the actual profit, you earn on your investment, calculating the real returns is recommended. The real rate makes the necessary adjustments on the profits for the effects on inflation and is an accurate measure of your actual earnings. Nominal returns are generally higher than the real rate of returns except when inflation is zero or in the case of a deflating economy. ### Real Rate of Return Calculation Let us understand how to calculate the real returns with an example. Assume that you have saved INR 1,00,000 to pay for a new car, but you decide to invest it in a fixed deposit for one year that provides a 5% rate of interest. On maturity, you will receive INR 1,05,000 on the deposit. Now consider that the rate of inflation during the year is 3%, which means the car now costs INR 1,03,000. Therefore, after paying for the car, you will be left with INR 2000 on your initial investment of INR 1,00,000, giving you real returns at 2% against the nominal fixed deposit interest rate of 5%. The real rate of return formula is \u2013 1 ### How to Calculate Absolute Return? Absolute return is the absolute profit or loss earned on your investments over a certain period. The profit or loss is generally shown as a percentage of the total investments. **The formula for calculating absolute return:** x 100 If you invest INR 20 lakhs in a property today and sell it for INR 25 lakhs after two years, the absolute return will be x 100 = 25% ## What Is Actual Profit? When you invest in different assets, you may study the historical returns, which are the nominal returns delivered by these products over a period. However, inflation and tax are real and affect your actual returns. The actual earnings are those that are adjusted for inflation and tax and are the amount that you will receive in your pocket.

The money market is where short-term assets with a maturity of up to one year are traded. These assets are usually traded by institutions which can process high volume trades. These financial assets are also highly liquid. So, they are comparatively safer and are used as near substitutes for money. Wondering what are money market instruments? Read on to know everything about them. ## What are money market instruments? Money market instruments are unsecured debt contracts that offer a fixed rate of return, and therefore, are theoretically riskier. However, they carry a high credit rating, indicating that the issuers do not default. Money market instruments are used to fulfil large yet short-term capital needs of businesses, banks, and governments. They are preferred by borrowers (issuers) with an immediate need for capital and lenders (investors) who want to preserve their cash requirements, invest for the short term, and earn fixed returns. Some features of money market instruments are as follows: * **Safe** : Since they are issued by businesses and popular banks, these have high credit ratings and are comparatively safer than other instruments. * **Liquid** : Money market instruments have high liquidity because they have a short maturity period and provide fixed returns. * **Discount on face value** : They are issued at a price lower than their face value. * **Higher Yields** : Money market funds have the potential to provide greater returns than traditional cash equivalents like savings accounts in addition to being safe and liquid. * **Risk Management** : Money market funds have low to moderate interest rate risk because they invest in securities with a one-year maturity or less. Since capital protection is their main priority, fund managers frequently invest in products with strong credit ratings. Money market funds therefore have a low risk profile. * **Steady Returns** : Due to the fact that fund values do not move much in reaction to changes in the financial markets, money market funds produce returns that are almost constant across cycles of interest rate tightening and easing. Money market funds are also less volatile than the majority of fixed-income instruments due to the low credit risk. ## Different types of money market instruments Several types of money market instruments are available to be traded for retailers like you. A few of these are given below: ### Treasury bills (T-Bills) Treasury bills or T-Bills are issued by the Indian Government to fulfill its short-term obligations. They are considered the safest among the money market instruments in India with a maturity period ranging from 14 days to 1 year. They are sold at a discounted rate but their full-face value is paid at the time of maturity, thus leaving room for capital gains. ### Commercial papers (CPs) Commercial papers include unsecured promissory notes that are issued by reputed, large companies. Since they are not secured, they offer higher returns than T-Bills. ### Certificate of deposits (CDs) These are negotiable term deposits that are accepted by banks. Certificates of deposits (CDs) differ from fixed deposits (FDs) as the former are freely negotiable and are issued for huge amounts like INR 1 lakh and its multiples. ### Commercial bills Commercial bills are another popular instrument of the Indian money market, and they work like bills of exchange. A bill of exchange is drawn on the buyer of certain goods by the seller of those goods. When a bank accepts this bill of exchange, it is called a commercial bill. A seller, when in need of money, can get this bill discounted. ### Call and Notice money Sometimes, banks and other financial institutions may borrow for a very short period to manage their cash flows. Call money is the short-term borrowing or lending of funds for a day whereas notice money refers to borrowing or lending for up to 14 days without any collateral. ### Repurchase agreements (Repo) Repurchase agreements are commonly referred to as repo or reverse repo. These are sale agreements wherein the party selling the security agrees to repurchase it from the buyer at a later date. The purchase price also includes a rate of interest that is known as the repo rate. Repos are effective tools to raise short-term funds for the seller and provide a decent rate of return on the investment to the buyer. ### Banker\u2019s Acceptance (BA) Certain individuals and organisations use a financial instrument created in the name of the bank. These are called Banker\u2019s Acceptance. The party issuing the instrument must pay its holder a stipulated amount within a period of 30 days to 180 days. The investor\u2019s profit is the difference between the issue price and the sale price. ## Differences between the stock market and the money market Here are some of the key differences between the stock market and the money market. ### Maturity Although stocks can be traded in the short term, they can be used effectively to generate wealth only when you stay invested for the long term. On the other hand, money market instruments have a maturity period of one year or less. ### Objective While stocks are typically used to fulfil long-term fund requirements, money market instruments are used to satisfy short-term needs. ### Instrument types The stock market consists of stocks of independently listed companies, whereas there are several types of money market instruments such as treasury bills, commercial bills, call money, and much more. ### Risk involved The stock market is usually a long-term investment; therefore, the risk factor is higher than money market instruments that are meant for the short term. ## Benefits of money market instruments ### Provide short-term liquidity For both sellers and buyers, they provide the advantage of liquidity because they are short-term investments. Since they are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they also maintain the level of liquidity in the economy. ### Utilise idle or surplus funds better Lenders can make good investments of their idle or surplus money. The borrower also benefits by receiving quick funds for the short term. ### Meet working capital requirements Money market instruments are useful in helping organisations meet the demand for their working capital. ### Determine crucial monetary policy decisions Since they largely make up the short-term market, they also influence the interest rate in the short run. This helps highlight the state of money and banking in the country, which eventually helps the RBI take a call on long-term interest rates and future monetary policy. ## Pros and Cons of Money Market Instruments ### Pros When compared to other fixed-income securities, money market instruments are more liquid. There is no lock-in period, so investors can sell their shares at any time. A money market instrument's return rate is marginally greater than a savings account's return rate. ### Cons The interest rate is greater than that of savings accounts. However, the rising inflation in the economy is unrelated to the interest rate. While other financial instruments, including mutual funds, offer a superior long-term return on investment. Money market instruments are not an option if the objective of the investment is to achieve capital appreciation while outperforming inflation. ## What are money market funds in India? Such funds are short-term that invest in various money market instruments. They are suitable for short-term profits while maintaining high liquidity. Here is a list of a few high-performing money market funds in India: * HDFC Money Market Fund - Growth * ICICI Prudential Money Market Fund - Growth * Aditya Birla Sun Life Money Manager Fund - Growth * SBI Savings Fund - Growth * Nippon India Money Market Fund - Growth ## Who should invest in money market mutual funds (MMMFs)? ### Beginners to investing Those new to the world of investing will find to their liking, especially because they are short-term. ### Individuals with surplus funds Those with extra funds in their bank accounts can consider investing in MMMFs because they tend to offer higher interest rates than other financial institutions. ### Individuals looking for liquidity and high short-term returns Money market instruments offer some of the highest returns in no time while ensuring high liquidity as they have a short maturity period. ## Things to know before investing in money market funds Similar to other financial markets, money market funds are also subject to fluctuations. So, consider the following things before you invest. * Money market funds are not ideal long-term investments. * The market trend has an impact on the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund. So, if the interest rate rises, then NAV may fall, thus reducing returns. * Expense ratios apply to these funds and depend on the Asset Management Company concerned. The expense ratio and the yield are inversely proportional. * As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, mutual funds are subject to tax gains. But capital gains in the short term are still taxable at 15%. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### Does somebody regulate the money market?

However, it is also one of the most important financial decisions. Therefore, you should take your time and not rush into any decision. With the rising real estate costs, it is most likely that you may not have the entire amount required to purchase the property. Therefore, you may avail of a loan from a bank or a non-banking financial company (NBFC). ## What is a mortgage? A mortgage is a type of secured loan that is taken for purchasing a home, land, or other types of real estate properties. The borrowed amount is repaid over a period in regular instalments comprising principal plus interest. The property is used as collateral. Moreover, you may apply for this loan either from a bank or an NBFC. To qualify for the loan, you need to meet certain requirements, such as minimum income, credit score, and down payment. ## What is a mortgage loan? A mortgage loan is also a secured credit facility where you can borrow a certain amount using an existing asset as collateral. It is a popular type of financing as it allows you to borrow a higher amount for a longer period. This type of loan is usually given against an immovable asset like your home or commercial property. It is also known as a loan against property (LAP). ## How does a mortgage work? Such debt is often for a longer duration, such as 15, 20, or 30 years. During the loan tenure, you repay both the principal amount and the interest. Generally, the total repayment amount is divided into equated monthly instalments (EMIs), which comprise principal and interest components. Finally, at the end of the tenure, you become the owner of the property. Every month, a portion of the EMI is adjusted against principal repayment and the balance against the interest. Initially, a higher amount is towards the interest payment. As you continue paying the EMIs, a higher amount is adjusted towards the principal repayment. In case of default or delays, the lender may repossess your property and sell it to recover any outstanding dues. ## Types of mortgages in India There are mainly six types of mortgages in India, which are as follows: ### Simple mortgage You borrow the money by offering an immovable personal asset as collateral. If you fail to repay the loan amount, the lender can sell the asset to recover their dues. ### Mortgage by title deed deposit You deposit the title deed of the mortgaged property with the lender to avail of the loan. ### Usufructuary mortgage Under this structure, the possession is transferred to the lenders. They receive profits or rent from the property and this type of mortgage does not create any personal liability for you. ### Mortgage by conditional sale In this structure, you sell your property on the condition that it becomes effective if you default on the repayment. The agreement is void when you repay the entire amount with the interest cost. ### English mortgage It establishes a personal liability for you and the mortgaged asset is transferred to the lender with the condition that it will be recovered after you repay the entire due amount. ### Anomalous mortgage Any mortgage that does not qualify under the above-mentioned types is considered here. ## Mortgage payment structure The borrowed amount is repaid in monthly instalments over the loan tenure. The EMI comprises the following two components. ### Principal This is the loan amount disbursed by the lender at the start of the tenure. Initially, a lower portion of the EMI is used towards principal repayment. ### Interest Lenders levy a certain mortgage loan interest rate, which is the cost of borrowing the money. At the start of the tenure, a higher portion of the amount is used for paying the interest. However, as you regularly pay the EMIs, a larger portion is adjusted towards principal repayment. Generally, the longer the loan tenure, the higher will be the interest outflow and vice versa. ## Steps to find the best mortgage You need to conduct extensive research and shop around to find the best deal. Spend some time exploring different options online to compare various factors, such as loan amount, tenure, mortgage loan rates, processing fees and other charges, and terms and conditions. Here are some things you can do to find the best deal. * Check your credit score and if required, take some time to improve your score to get the best deal. * Know all the available options and familiarize yourself with common terms and conditions. * Compare the different rates and terms offered by various lenders. * Read the agreement thoroughly and check the fine print to ensure there are no surprises in the future. ## Useful mortgage terminologies to learn * Collateral: The asset given as security to cover the loan amount. * EMI: This is the monthly amount you will pay towards loan and interest payments. * Tenure: It is the duration over which you repay the borrowed amount. * Interest: The cost of borrowing can either be at a fixed or flexible rate. * Loan to value (LTV) ratio: This is the ratio between the loan amount and the property value. ## Things to remember before opting for a mortgage * Ensure your credit report is correct and get any anomalies rectified before applying for the loan. * Determine how much loan you can afford and do your homework. * Gain a preliminary understanding of how these loans work and know the common terms and conditions like interest rates, tenure, and loan amount. * Check processing fees, prepayment charges, default penalties, and other costs. This type of loan can be useful to meet personal or business fund requirements. However, like all loans, you must repay them on time to avoid severe consequences and late payment charges. Take time to check out different options and make an informed decision to avoid facing any financial crises.

You may choose from different types of financial instruments to put your money in. An investment portfolio is the collection of various products like stocks, mutual funds, bonds, fixed deposits, cash, and other assets. Read on to know everything about managing your investment portfolio. ## What is portfolio management? You may choose different financial instruments to add to your investment portfolio based on various factors such as the investible surplus, investment horizon, financial goal, risk appetite, and much more. The process of selecting the right financial products to maximize returns while minimizing risks is known as portfolio management. It considers individual requirements to achieve an ideal portfolio mix. ## Why is portfolio management required? The portfolio management process helps you determine the most appropriate investment plan based on your income, capital, financial goals, age, and risk appetite. With the right portfolio management services, you can build wealth over the long term. Portfolio managers offer customized solutions and recommend the most beneficial products based on your requirements and objectives. ## What are the objectives of portfolio management? The objectives of portfolio management are as follows: * Creating wealth through capital appreciation * Protecting your earnings from market volatility * Maximizing returns on investment (ROI) * Offering flexibility within your investment portfolio * Improving the proficiency of your investments * Allocating available resources optimally * Optimizing the risk ## Types of portfolio management Portfolio management services can be classified under the following four types. ### Active management The primary objective of the portfolio manager is to maximize returns. Generally, a majority of the investible surplus is used to buy and sell securities for higher ROI. Typically, the manager will buy stocks when they are undervalued and sell them for a profit when the price increases. ### Passive management Under passive management, the portfolio manager aligns the investments to match current market trends to earn fixed returns. Generally, the investments are in index funds that deliver steady but relatively lower returns over the long term. ### Discretionary management When you opt for discretionary investment portfolio management, you authorize the manager to take care of your financial requirements. You provide a certain amount to the portfolio manager to invest on your behalf. Additionally, the manager takes care of documentation, filing, and other paperwork. Based on your financial goals and risk appetite, the portfolio manager has complete authority to choose the financial instruments they deem the best. ### Non-discretionary management In this case, the portfolio manager will offer advice on the different investment options that suit your requirements. However, the decision to invest or not entirely lies with you. ## Who should invest in portfolio management services (PMS)? The following individuals are recommended to opt for professional investment analysis and portfolio management services. * Those who are looking to invest in different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds, and others but do not have the required knowledge and expertise. * Individuals who do not have the time to regularly monitor their investment portfolios and make the required modifications. * Those who have limited knowledge about the investment markets and do not understand the influence of market movements on different asset classes. ## Different ways to manage any portfolio Portfolio managers may adopt various ways to manage investment portfolios. Some of these are as follows: ### Asset allocation Your money is invested in market-related and fixed-income securities to minimize risk while maximizing ROI. The asset allocation depends on your risk profile and financial objectives. ### Diversification The investment portfolio is diversified across various products and is revamped to achieve the ideal balance between risk and reward. It can deliver risk-adjusted returns over the long term. ### Rebalancing The investment portfolio is regularly monitored to rebalance the instruments to align with changing market conditions. It aims to include assets that deliver higher profits at minimal losses. ## Portfolio Management Process * Identify suitable goals, such as capital appreciation or stable ROI * Estimate potential returns and related investment risks * Asset allocation to achieve the optimal risk-reward ratio * Determine investment strategies that align with your investment horizon and risk profile * Conduct extensive research and analyze various financial instruments to make informed investment decisions * Regularly monitor and evaluate the portfolio to maximize capital efficiency * Rebalance the asset allocation to maximize returns ## Tools and methods of portfolio management Generally, scoring techniques are adopted to arrive at accurate financial decisions to increase ROI and make strategic decisions for investment project portfolio management. The two common scoring techniques are as follows: ### Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) Method It uses regular arithmetic operations like multiplication and addition. The attribute values are numerical and comparable. ### Weight Product Method The weights are exponents linked to each attribute value. The method assigns positive power for benefit attributes and negative power for cost attributes. The steps to derive scores and weights are as follows: * Identification of applicable non-monetary attributes * Providing weight to the attributes based on their comparative importance * Scoring the alternatives to reflect the performance of each option against every attribute * Calculating the weighted scores * Testing the results for accuracy * Interpreting the results ## Factors to consider before investing in PMS One of the most important things to consider is understanding what portfolio management is before availing of such services. Some of the other factors to consider are as follows: * Analyze risks like interest rates, inflation, market, and others. * Such services come at a cost like performance fees, management charges, exit and entry loads, brokerage, and much more. * To make an informed decision, evaluate the past performance of the portfolio manager to determine how much returns they have delivered. * Ensure the chosen service provider offers transparent investment philosophy and decision-making procedure and gives regular updates on your portfolio. * Understand the investment strategies adopted by the PMS to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and requirements. * Determine the quality of the portfolio manager based on factors like experience, qualifications, and historical performance. * Make sure the chosen PMS is registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Tax planning plays an instrumental role in deciding how much you pay to the government. If you fail to plan your taxes, you might end up paying more than you actually should. This article will give you insights on how to save tax and take advantage of the several tax deductions to lower your tax burden. ## **What Is Income Tax?** Income tax is one of the significant sources of revenue for the government. It is a type of charge that you pay on the income you earn in a financial year. The money is collected to improve the infrastructure of the country and the well-being of the citizens in general. In India, you must pay your taxes according to specific income slabs. For instance, the income tax paid by a person who earns INR 6,00,000 per annum would be different from someone who pulls in about INR 50,00,000. The Income Tax Department has decided the tax rates for each income slab as shown below: **Income Slab** | **Tax Rate** ---|--- < INR 2,50,000 | 0% INR 2,50,000 \u2013 INR 5,00,000 | 5% INR 5,00,000 \u2013 INR 7,50,000 | 10% INR 7,50,000 \u2013 INR 10,00,000 | 15% INR 10,00,000 \u2013 INR 12,50,000 | 20% INR 12,50,000 \u2013 INR 15,00,000 | 25% > INR 15,00,000 | 30% These tax slabs have been defined under the new tax regime and implemented from FY 2020-21. While calculating your tax amount, make sure that you consider any professional tax deductions that can be availed. ## **Difference Between Old and New Tax Regime** Under the old tax regime, there were only three income slabs. Even the rate of tax was higher compared to the new tax system. **Income Slab** | **Tax Rate** ---|--- < INR 2,50,000 | 0% INR 2,50,000 \u2013 INR 5,00,000 | 5% INR 5,00,000 \u2013 INR 10,00,000 | INR 12,500 + 20% of the income above INR 5,00,000 > INR 10,00,000 | INR 1,12,500 + 30% of the income above INR 10,00,000 You can move forward with the old system if you wish to do so, as you can claim most income tax deductions, including house rent allowances (HRA) and leave travel concessions. You can also claim deductions for tax-saving investments under section 80C to 80U. However, these tax deductions are not available for people who opt to pay taxes in lines with the new regime. Some income tax deductions that you can avail under the new regime include: 1. Transport allowances for differently-abled people. 2. Conveyance allowance received for the money spent in a conveyance that forms the part of the employment. 3. Daily allowances to meet the regular charges incurred on the place of duty. ## **Ways to Save Tax in India** There are several **tax-saving schemes** that you can utilise to save some additional tax money. To understand **how to reduce income tax,** take a look at the options given below: 1. **Buy Life Insurance:** When you buy a life insurance policy, you are obligated to pay monthly or yearly premiums. Under Section 80C, these premiums are eligible for tax deductions, i.e., you will not have to pay any taxes on the amount of premium you pay. 2. **Public Provident Fund (PPF):** PPF is a saving scheme where you can keep some money aside for a tenure of 15 years. You can opt for this scheme from any bank or post office in India. The rate of interest earned on these savings changes every quarter, and the interest earned via this scheme is tax-free. 3. **Tuition Fees:** The amount of money you pay as tuition fees for your kids is eligible for a tax deduction of up to INR 1,50,000 every year. 4. **Rent Receipts:** If you are stationed in rental accommodation and receive HRA as part of your compensation, you can claim tax deductions on the same under Section 10 (13A). 5. **Charity:** If you donate a specific part of your income to some charitable organisation or a relief fund, you can claim a tax deduction under Section 80G. 6. **Higher Education:** If you take a loan to sponsor your higher education, the interest paid would be available for a tax deduction under section 80E. However, you can claim this deduction for a maximum period of 8 years. 7. **Buy a House:** Buying a home not only gives you stability but also saves your tax money. If you have a taxable property and pay your home loan, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest. Also, if you are a first-time house buyer, you get an additional deduction from the taxable income of INR 50,000 on the home loan interest. ## **Tax Saving Investment Options Under Section 80C** Section 80C provides you with several investment options with which you can claim income tax deductions and save money. Under this section, you are eligible for deductions up to INR 1.5 lakhs in a financial year. The investment options are as follows: **Investment** | **Returns** | **Lock-in Period** ---|---|--- 5-Year Bank fixed deposit | 6% - 7% | 5 Years National Savings Certificate | 7% - 8% | 5 Years Public Provident Fund (PPF) | 7% - 8% | 15 Years National Pension Scheme | 12% - 14% | Till Retirement ELSS Funds | 15% to 18% | 3 Years Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna | 7.6% | Not Applicable Senior Citizen Saving Scheme | 7.4% | 5 Years You can avail of these investment options to get professional tax deductions on the amount invested. ## Tax Saving Investment Options in India Other Than Sec 80C There are tax saving options other than 80C that you can avail of. These generally include health insurance premiums, home loan interest, etc. 1. **Medical Insurance Premium:** Under Section 80D, you can claim up to INR 1,00,000 per annum for deduction if your insurance policy covers any senior citizen. If a senior citizen is not a part of the policy, you can claim medical expenditure up to INR 50,000. 2. **Interest on Home Loan:** A tax deduction can be claimed for up to INR 2,00,000 per annum under Section 24. 3. **Home Loan:** If you take a home loan, your taxable income is reduced as you can claim the principal loan amount up to INR 1.5 lakhs. 4. **Charity:** Any charity or donation made to a relief fund or an NGO can be claimed as a deduction under 80G. 5. **Interest on Education Loan:** You can get a deduction for this under section 80E. ## **How to Plan Your Tax Saving Investments for the Year** There are several ways in which you can start planning your tax-saving investments. It's best to start small and then gradually increase the number of investments. 1. Check all your expenses and identify where you can save up some tax money like your child\u2019s tuition fees, interest paid on education loan, home loan repayment, etc. 2. Now, total the amount and deduct it from INR 1.5 lakhs to figure out how much can you invest. 3. Choose an investment option that fits your appetite. For instance, you can open a PPF account to start saving. If you're not sure which investment vehicle is most suitable for you, it's wise to consult a financial planner. ### Tax Planning for Salaried Employees If you are a salaried employee and want to know how to save tax on your salary, follow these tips: 1. Look into HRA exemption and submit your rent receipts in time to your employer. 2. Check if your company can reimburse you for medical bills. 3. Another tax benefit worth looking into is Leave Travel Allowance (LTA). Your employer can cover all travel expenses related to work, which might be included in your salary. Salaried employees need to trace these areas at the beginning of the year and start saving. Speak to your employer about restructuring your pay so that you are eligible for these tax deductions. ## **FAQs** **Q. How can I save capital gain tax under Section 54?** This deduction is available for long term capital assets. You are eligible for this tax break if you buy a house within one year before the date of transfer of ownership of your home or within two years after that. **Q. Can I claim a deduction if I contribute to the PM Care Fund?** Yes, you can claim deductions under section 80G for any charitable donation that you make. **Q. Can a self-employed person claim HRA exemption?** No, self-employed individuals cannot avail the HRA exemption. Only salaried employees that opt for the old tax regime are eligible for this deduction.

Many people struggle to determine where to put their money as all plans come with different rules and regulations. Presently, two popular financial instruments are unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) and mutual funds. This article explains the differences between both these options to help you make an informed decision. ## What is ULIP? A common question asked by many potential investors is, \u201cwhat is ULIP?\u201d Well, it is a combination of a life insurance policy and other investment options. When you opt for it, the fund managers use a portion of your money to create your life insurance policy, and put the remaining amount in debt, equity, or a hybrid fund as per your investment goal and risk appetite. A Unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP) is a suitable option for long-term financial planning as it allows your money to grow over a period. ## What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a financial product that pools money from different investors with similar goals and puts the capital in various assets such as bonds and securities. Experienced and professional fund managers are responsible for investing the money on your behalf so that you get the best possible returns. The three main types of mutual funds are as follows: ### 1\\. Equity funds In this type of mutual fund, the fund managers put at least 65% of your money in equities. These funds can potentially offer higher returns, but their performance depends on the financial market. The different types of equity-based mutual funds are as follows: * Small-cap funds * Mid-cap funds * Large-cap funds * Multi-cap funds * Equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) * Thematic funds * Index funds ### 2\\. Debt funds When you opt for debt-based mutual funds, at least 65% of your money is invested in safe, fixed-income products like certificates of deposit, government bonds, treasury bills, and others. Below is a list of different types of debt funds: * Dynamic bonds * Income funds * Short-term debt funds * Ultra-short-term debt funds * Liquid funds * Gilt funds * Credit opportunities funds * Fixed maturity plans ### 3\\. Balanced mutual funds This type of mutual funds balance risk and return by investing your money in both equity- and debt-based options. The fund managers can reallocate your funds between the debt and equity instruments depending on the financial market conditions. The different types of balanced mutual funds are as follows: * Equity-oriented funds * Debt-oriented funds * Monthly income plans * Arbitrage funds You can invest in mutual funds in two ways, a systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and one-time payment. * **SIP** : This option allows you to invest small amounts in mutual funds over time. You may choose from different payment frequency options\u2014bi-annually, quarterly, and monthly\u2014as per your comfort. * **One-time payment** : If you have a lump sum to invest, this is the ideal option for you. In this scenario, you invest some amount in a mutual fund through one transaction and wait for your money to grow over time. ## ULIPs vs. Mutual Funds - Where Should I Invest? Deciding whether to invest in a ULIP or mutual fund will be easier if you compare both options based on returns and additional benefits. Read on to get a better idea. ### 1\\. How ULIPs and mutual funds work? When it comes to ULIPs vs. mutual funds with death cover, the benefit can differ based on your policy. For instance, if you wish to invest \u20b925,000 a month to create a substantial life cover, the death benefit from both options**** will be as follows: * **ULIPs** : You can expect a death benefit of \u20b930 lakhs in four years, and \u20b941 lakhs in 10 years. * **Mutual funds with life insurance** : The death benefit will be \u20b938 lakhs in four years, and \u20b968 lakhs in 10 years. ### 2\\. Benefits and reasons to invest in ULIPs Some noteworthy _ULIP benefits_ that make them a great investment option _**** are as follows_: * _**Life cover**_ : **ULIPs** offer death benefits along with investment options. It ensures your loved ones remain financially secure in your absence. * **Switching option** : The fund-switching option lets you reallocate your money between equity and debt funds depending on your changing investment goals and the financial market condition. Insurers allow you a fixed number of free switches. * **Tax benefits** : Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your investments tax-exempted up to \u20b91.5 lakhs a year. Moreover, if your yearly premium is up to \u20b92.5 lakhs, the maturity proceeds will be tax-free under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, if your annual premium is over \u20b92.5 lakhs, the proceeds will not be tax exempt. Additionally, you do not have to pay any tax for fund withdrawal and switching. ### 3\\. Benefits and reasons to invest in mutual funds Mutual funds offer the following benefits, which make them an attractive investment option. * **Fund managers** : Experienced fund managers handle your investments to meet your goals while managing risk. * **No lock-in period** : Most mutual funds do not have any lock-in period. So, you can withdraw money from the fund as per your needs while adhering to the policy regulations. * **Flexibility** : Mutual funds are more flexible compared to other investment options. They offer benefits like fund switching, SIP, diverse investment avenues, and much more. * **Tax benefits** : ELSS is a type of mutual fund that offers tax benefits of up to \u20b91.5 lakhs a year under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Although it has a three-year lock-in period, it is shorter compared to other tax-saving investment options. ## Things to consider before investing in ULIPs There are a few things that you must take into consideration before investing in ULIPs. These include the following. * **Personal goals** : **ULIPs** are suitable for wealth creation in the long run. So, you must determine your future financial goals before investing. If you want to build a retirement fund or accumulate money for any other significant purpose, long-term investment in these plans may be beneficial. * **Lock-in period** : They have a five-year lock-in period. Moreover, if you surrender the policy for any reason within the first three years of investment, you may lose the life cover. * **Charges** : **ULIPs** entail multiple associated fees such as a 1.35% fund management charge, premium allocation cost, administrative charge, and much more. The insurance company deducts these costs from the premium. Furthermore, you have to pay an underwriting fee and commission. All these ULIP charges need to be paid when purchasing the policy and may affect your overall return. ## Tips to choose the best ULIPs To choose the best ULIPs for investment, you must keep the following tips in mind. * Determine how much life insurance cover you need. * Choose a plan according to your financial goals. * Find out about the fees your insurer charges. * Learn about the features of different ULIPs before buying one. * Know about all the tax benefits. ### Consider investing in mutual funds and term insurance instead of ULIP (with an example) As mentioned earlier, ULIPs**** offer a death benefit of \u20b930 lakhs in four years and \u20b941 lakhs in 10 years for a monthly investment of \u20b925,000. But, if you invest the same amount in a mutual fund and \u20b91,000 per month in a term policy separately, you will get a higher life cover. For the monthly investment of \u20b926,000, you will get a life cover of over \u20b91 crore in four years and 1.43 crores in 10 years. For low-cost and flexible investment, opt for a term insurance cover that is 15 times your yearly income and put the remaining amount in mutual funds. ## FAQs ### 1\\. What is the sum assured in ULIP? The sum assured is the minimum amount an insurer guarantees to pay the nominee in the case of the policyholder\u2019s untimely demise during the policy tenure. ### 2\\. What is fund value in ULIP? A fund is made of units that have a Net Asset Value (NAV, which can change every day. The total monetary value of the units owned by you is known as the fund value. To determine this, multiply the NAV of each unit on a particular day by the total number of units you have. ### 3\\. Is ULIP better than mutual funds? ULIPs allow you to build a fortune over time while providing a life insurance cover under one policy. However, if you invest in a mutual fund instead and buy a term life insurance policy separately, it will guarantee a significantly higher death benefit. ### 4\\. Which is better investment ULIPs or mutual fund? Mutual funds offer better returns than ULIPs ### 5\\. Why you should invest in ULIP now? Unit-Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) will have the benefit of both life insurance and investment returns. You should analyse your personal financial goals, lock-in period and charges before investing in a ULIP because the returns might be lesser compared to Mutual funds.

Through the senior citizen saving scheme (SCSS), citizens aged above 60 can invest and earn a regular income to cover their expenses. Read to find out more about the senior citizen savings scheme, interest rate, and benefits. ## What is the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme? The senior citizen savings scheme (SCSS) is a post office savings scheme for citizens aged above 60. Being a government-backed retirement scheme, it is risk-free. It offers regular income in the form of interest to the depositors who invest in lumpsum, either individually or jointly. The interest is paid every quarter at the interest rate decided by the government. SCSS matures after five years; however, the tenure can be extended for another three years. The following are the features of the senior citizen savings scheme: ### Minimum and maximum deposit The minimum amount of deposit for the scheme is Rs 1,000 or in multiples of Rs 1,000. The maximum amount of deposit is Rs 30 lakhs. In Union Budget 2023, the finance minister has increased the limit from Rs 15 lakhs to Rs 30 lakhs. You can deposit in cash or cheque. However, cash is only accepted if the deposit amount is below Rs 1 lakh. For deposits greater than Rs 1 lakh, you must pay through cheque. ### Number of accounts You can open more than one account for SCSS at an authorized bank or post office near you. All accounts can be either individual or joint accounts. ### Interest rate The interest rate for SCSS is decided by the government every quarter. For the January 2023 quarter, the interest rate on the scheme is 8% per annum. The interest is paid every quarter and gets credited to your bank account on the first of April, July, October, and January. Although the government changes the interest every quarter, the interest rate on the day you invest gets locked in for the entire tenure. ### Tenure As discussed above, the maximum tenure for the scheme is five years. It can be extended for another three years by submitting an application to the bank or post office. The application should be given in the fourth year, i.e., one year before the scheme matures. ### Nomination SCSS has a nomination facility. Hence you can nominate a person for your investment either at the time of opening the account or during the tenure. ### Premature withdrawals and closure You can withdraw your money prematurely without any penalty one year from account opening. However, if you withdraw after one year but before two years from account opening, you must pay a penalty of 1.5% on the principal. If in case, you withdraw it after two years, but within five years, you will be charged 1% as a penalty on the principal. ## How SCSS works? If you are aged above 60, you are eligible to invest in a senior citizen savings scheme. You can open an account at any bank or the nearest post office. You can open individual or joint accounts with a minimum investment of Rs 1,000 and a maximum of Rs 30 lakhs. Once you open the account, you will get interest payments every quarter, which will be credited to your bank account. At present, the interest rate is 8% per annum, but it changes every quarter, as per the government's guidelines. The scheme has a tenure of five years. At the end of five years, the principal amount is given back to you. You can also choose to extend the scheme for another three years to receive interest. Since the scheme is backed by the government, it is completely risk-free. So, you need not worry about your investments during retirement. ## Eligibility for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme To invest in SCSS, you must be eligible. The following are the eligibility criteria. * Only Indian citizens aged above 60 years can invest in the scheme. * Retirees between the ages of 55 and 60 who have opted for voluntary retirement or superannuation. * Retired defence personnel aged above 50 but below 60 years * Non-resident Indians (NRI), Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), and members of Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) cannot invest in the scheme. ## Documents required to open SCSS account Following are the documents required to open a senior citizen savings scheme account. * Proof of age \u2013 Senior citizen identity card, birth certificate, PAN Card, Voter ID * Proof of identity \u2013 Aadhar Card, Pan Card, Passport * Proof of address \u2013 Aadhar Card, telephone bills, or other utility bills * Two passport-size photographs All copies of the documents must be self-attested by the depositor ## Interest rate calculation for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) The interest on SCSS is paid every quarter on the first of April, July, October, and January. So this means the annual interest is divided into four parts and is paid to the depositor. Let\u2019s understand the interest calculation with the help of an example. ### Example If the principal amount is Rs 10,00,000 per annum, and the current interest rate is 8%. The interest per quarter is calculated as given below. Interest = 1000000*8/(100*4) Interest = Rs 20,000 The interest per annum would be Rs 80,000 (Rs 20,000*4). And the interest amount for five years would be Rs 4,00,000. Principal| Rs 10,00,000 ---|--- Interest (%)| 8% Term| Five years Interest per quarter| Rs 20,000 Interest per annum| Rs 80,000 Interest for five years| Rs 4,00,000 The interest amount will be directly credited to your bank account at the end of the quarter. However, if the interest amount exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year or if you fail to submit form 15G/15H, then TDS (tax deducted at source) will be deducted. ## Why is SCSS a good investment option? The senior citizen savings scheme is a good investment alternative for senior citizens looking for an alternative source of income. Following are some of the reasons why you should consider putting your money in this scheme. * **Simple investing process:** Investing in SCSS is very simple. You can open an SCSS account with any authorized bank or post office. * **Risk-free investment:** The scheme is backed by the government and hence is considered risk-free. * **Guaranteed returns:** SCSS pays interest on the principal amount every quarter. Hence it is one of the most reliable investments for senior citizens. * **High rate of interest:** The scheme pays an 8% return per annum, which is higher than a savings account and fixed deposits. * **Regular interest payouts:** The interest is paid out every quarter, making it a secondary source of income for retirees. * **Tax benefits:** Invest in SCSS qualifies for tax benefits up to Rs 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. Hence you can claim a deduction on your investment in the scheme. * **Option to extend tenure:** The scheme has a fixed tenure of five years. However, you can extend it for another three years. Hence you can earn interest for an additional three years. ## Disadvantages of SCSS * **Interest is subject to TDS:** The interest is subject to TDS if the interest is above Rs 50,000 per annum. * **Upper limit:** The upper limit of the scheme is Rs 30 lakhs. Even if the investors want to invest above this limit, they cannot invest. * **No compounding benefits:** Regular interest payouts act as a source of second income for retirees. However, due to regular interest payouts, the investor doesn\u2019t receive any compounding benefit. ## Premature closure of SCSS account and withdrawal of money Although SCSS has a fixed tenure of five years, the government allows premature withdrawal and closure. Following are the premature rules and penalties of the scheme. If you wish to withdraw within one year from the date of investment, there will be no penalty. In case you want to withdraw after one year but before two years, then a penalty of 1.5% on the principal is charged. If you withdraw after two years, then a penalty of 1% on the principal is charged. However, if the investor deceases before maturity, then no penalties will be charged. ## List of Banks offering Senior Citizen Savings Scheme Apart from the post office, the following banks are authorized to accept SCSS deposits. Allahabad Bank| Central Bank of India| Indian Overseas Bank ---|---|--- Andhra Bank| Corporation Bank| Punjab National Bank Bank of India| Dena Bank| State Bank of India Bank of Baroda| ICICI Bank| Syndicate Bank Bank of Maharashtra| IDBI Bank| UCO Bank Canara Bank| Indian Bank| Union Bank of India ## Tax implications of SCSS The investment made in SCSS qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the interest is taxable as per the investor\u2019s income tax slab rate. Moreover, the interest is subject to TDS if the interest earned is above Rs 50,000 per annum. ## What is the Post Office Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)?

All of us flock to these instruments with visions of supplementary income, building a retirement plan, or even achieving (a.k.a \u201cseeing the world\u201d or \u201copening my own microbrewery\u201d). _However_ \u2013 these instruments depend heavily on the market\u2019s performance. And while their returns look promising, they can swing unexpectedly between \u2018exciting\u2019 and \u2018worrying\u2019. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to also invest in more stable and safer items \u2013 instruments that aren\u2019t as dependent on the market, but still hold great value in your portfolio. Instruments that have a _low correlation_ to the market\u2019s performance. Welcome to the world of Low Correlation Assets \u2013 we\u2019re talking about government-issued bonds, cold gold, and even hard cash. (Account balance works too; we\u2019re not picky about cash-stuffed mattresses). These assets don\u2019t always boast super-high, inflation-beating returns. But during times of economic uncertainties (like right now), they are the ones that remain largely stable. ## **Shouldn't my investment mantra be \"growth growth, growth\"?** Yes and no. While your idea of investing is growing your wealth and consistently reaping positive returns \u2013 it\u2019s the market that gets to crush or lift your dreams between 9:15 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. every day. The Rs. 1,000 you invested today could become Rs. 1,200 tomorrow; which could fall to Rs. 800 the day after. Consider the recent, sudden fall in the markets. It shows us how delicate investment returns can be in the face of recession and black swan events. Some of us are even witnessing a complete wipe-out of investment gains made in mutual funds over the past 3 years. Ouch! But it\u2019s exactly during these times that low-correlation assets shine bright \u2013 they help soften such blows by serving as a safe-guard against drastic depletion of wealth during falling markets. That\u2019s why, it\u2019s okay to have gold locked away in a bank locker or have cash stashed away in mattresses and pillows. As long as the IT department knows about it, you\u2019re probably doing yourself a favour. ## **Sooo I should just go out and buy gold?** Again, yes\u2026and no. There are more options. Take Gilt Funds for instance. These are funds that invest only in debt that\u2019s backed by a sovereign (government) guarantee. They are issued by the RBI on behalf of the government and do not invest in corporate bonds. Which means their value doesn\u2019t depend on corporations being able to pay their debts. No points for guessing why they\u2019re so stable. Fact is, we undervalue such assets when the markets are doing well, because their returns pale in comparison to market-linked instruments. If you\u2019ve followed gilt funds or even gold prices over the past few years, you may feel like they have underperformed and not delivered the returns you\u2019d want from a typical \u201cinvestment.\u201d But look at _any_ graph now and it\u2019s clear that they are doing better than market-related investments. The HDFC Gold Fund has surged every time the equity markets have corrected. But when the equity market was surging, the HDFC Gold fund showed a more benign (stable) performance. Then there\u2019s the HDFC Gilt fund \u2013 which not only shows returns that are safe and steady, but a better-than-inflation return even at its worst point of entry! And that\u2019s what makes it worth slotting such assets into your portfolio \u2013 you\u2019re relatively covered against the impact of a recession or unforeseen market falls. ## **GILT... FUND... EVERYTHING** No! No! It\u2019s all about balance. Talk to your financial advisor to work out how you should split your investments between risky, relatively safe and super-safe low-correlation assets. And while we can\u2019t give you a broad suggestion for the first two, we can advise making gilt funds and gold a part of your investments. They have the advantage of not being as connected to the markets, and are thus more stable. Of course, you can also include such assets outside of your \u2018investment portfolio\u2019. Think back to our first blog about building an . You could hold this entire amount (worth ~6 months of your salary or 10% of your portfolio, whichever is higher) purely in the form of low-correlation assets! Yes, introducing such assets into your portfolio can reduce the upside for you to a certain extent, but think of it this way: When the market is volatile (like in recent times), which asset would you want to liquidate to buy into a steadying equity market? Gold, gilt funds and government-issued bonds are fairly liquid and give you the leverage to take advantage of market lows. So while it may seem like these assets don\u2019t offer supernormal returns, they certainly make for an important part of every portfolio. Some might even say they\u2019re worth their weight in gold.

Wondering what are mutual funds? We have got you covered. This type of investment is made by Asset Management Companies (AMCs). They collect money from institutional and individual investors and put it in different securities. These companies have experienced fund managers who invest the money on your behalf to generate returns as per your goal. A mutual fund is one of the best investment products in India to beat inflation. ## What is inflation? Before you in mutual funds, it is important to understand how inflation affects your corpus. Inflation is the increase in the cost of services and goods over a period. The inflation rate in India is around 5%, which is higher than the interest rate offered by banks. So, the interest earned from your savings account is not enough to fight inflation. But you can manage it by investing in the right types of mutual funds based on your financial objectives. ### Tips for investing in mutual funds Before you start investing in these funds, you must determine your financial goal and understand the different types of options available. Here are some tips that will help you get an idea about how to go about with mutual fund investments. **1\\. Defining your investment goal** It always helps to put money in mutual funds with a clear investment goal. The fund managers invest your money in either equity or debt funds, based on your financial objective. If you want to create a retirement fund or buy a house, you need to stay invested in equity-based instruments for over an extended period. To achieve your short-term goals, debt-based investment options should suffice. **2\\. Achieving long-term objectives** When you invest in equity mutual funds to achieve long-term goals, the fund managers buy shares of different companies with your capital. There are four types of equity mutual funds\u2014large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multicap. * **Large cap** : This type of fund generally invests in the top 100 companies in terms of their market share. Some of these companies are Reliance Industries Limited, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and more. The large-cap funds have offered 7% to 8% returns over the last five years. As these blue-chip companies have almost no possibilities of going bankrupt, your investment will be safe. Suppose you have 30 years left until retirement and want to accumulate a decent amount of wealth, investing in the large-cap mutual funds in India can help. If you start putting \u20b930,000 a month in these funds, your total investment at the end of 30 years will be \u20b91.08 crores. If the fund offers 8% interest, it will generate a profit of \u20b93.42 crores by that time. So, the total fund value will be \u20b94.50 crores. Similarly, if you wish to buy a house, you need to invest \u20b941,000 every month to accumulate \u20b975 lakhs in 10 years from large-cap mutual funds. * **Mid cap** : These mutual funds invest in mid-sized companies like Voltas, Bata, supermarkets, and others. In the last five years, these companies have offered 11% to 12% returns on investment. These mutual funds can help you generate significant returns, but they also expose you to high risk. If you use the same example as above, by investing in mid-cap mutual funds with 11% returns, you can accumulate a retirement fund of \u20b98.50 crores in 30 years. And, for buying a house, you need to invest \u20b934,500 a month for 10 years to accrue \u20b975 lakhs. * **Small cap** : A small-cap fund buys shares of companies that have a market capitalization of less than 500 crores. In the last five years, they have offered returns at a rate of 14% to 15%; however, they entail high risk. in these funds, you can create a retirement fund of around \u20b921 crores in 30 years based on the above example. And to accumulate \u20b975 lakhs for buying a house in 10 years, investing a monthly amount of \u20b927,000 in small-cap funds should be enough. * **Multicap** : These funds invest in shares of the different large, medium, and small companies to diversify your portfolio. Their returns are like mid-cap funds, but the risk is comparatively lower due to diversification. **3\\. Achieving short-term goals** If you have short-term investment goals and do not want to take high risk, a large-cap fund/mid-cap fund is not for you. A debt-based mutual fund is best suited for investment goals shorter than five years. These funds invest in securities like government bonds, commercial papers, and treasury bills. These are fixed-income options that offer pre-determined interest and are not affected by market volatility. There are around 16 types of low-risk debt mutual funds. We have detailed the two primary ones. * **Liquid funds** : Liquid funds are great savings options as they allow you to withdraw money at any time. These funds offer a 7% to 8% interest rate, making them much better than bank savings accounts. It is excellent for accumulating a small fund to meet short-term goals, like a Europe trip. If you invest \u20b910,000 every month for two years in a liquid mutual fund offering a 7.5% interest rate, you will get a return of \u20b92.60 lakhs. And this amount is more than enough for the trip. * **Dynamic bond fund** : Suppose you want to buy a good car in five years, a dynamic bond fund can help you achieve that goal. It is a low-risk investment avenue that offers 8% to 9% interest. So, if you invest \u20b915,000 a month for five years, you will have a total of \u20b911.40 lakhs at the end of the term. ## List of best mutual funds to invest for beginners Many Indian AMCs offer mutual funds. Presently, some of the best options for beginners are as follows: * Axis Long Term Equity Fund * Aditya Birla Mutual Funds * HDFC Mutual Funds * Mirae Asset Large-Cap Fund * SBI Bluechip Fund * Axis Focused 25 Fund * SBI Focused Equity Fund **Tax-saving mutual funds in India** Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) is the only equity mutual fund in India that offers tax benefits. ELSS mutual funds offer high returns of approximately 10% to 11% and have a lock-in period of only three years. Your investment in ELSS is tax-deductible up to \u20b91.50 lakhs annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ### Things to consider before investing in mutual funds **1\\. Fund\u2019s track record** Before choosing a fund, conduct thorough research online to get an idea about how it has performed over the last few years. This will help you determine which fund can offer you the best returns. **2\\. Fund manager** Not all fund managers can perform equally. So, it is advisable to check who your fund manager is and how they have performed in the past. Only professionally experienced fund managers can get you the expected result. **3\\. Exit load** The exit load is a fee that the AMCs charge when you close the account early. They levy it to encourage you to stay invested for an extended period. A high exit load will lower your profits. **4\\. Expense ratio** AMCs charge you the expense ratio to manage your investments. They use the fee to meet expenses like the fund manager\u2019s salary. Before investing in a mutual fund, check its expense ratio. The lower it is, the higher will be your return. Mutual fund schemes come in different types with various benefits, interest rates, charges, and regulations. So, you must compare different options to find a mutual fund that best suits your requirements.

They are professionally managed instruments and are an excellent alternative for investors who want to invest but do not understand the stock markets. Mutual funds also have a high potential to give high returns, helping investors build long-term wealth. This could be why Mutual Funds have gained immense popularity in the last few years. Read to find out how mutual funds have evolved in the last sixty years. ## Mutual funds and the economy Although the Mutual Fund industry was born way back in 1963, it only gained importance post-1991 economic reforms. Why's that? The private sector and foreign companies were allowed to introduce new Mutual Funds to India. This led to a surge in the number of Mutual Fund Houses or Asset Management Companies, investors, and total assets under management (AUM). The AUM increased from Rs 470 billion in 1993 to \u20b9 39,46,257 crore in 2023, a 25% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in 30 years. This shows how quickly Mutual Funds gained popularity in the Indian markets ## So how do mutual funds contribute to the Indian economy? Mutual Funds act as financial intermediaries. This means they facilitate money transfers from investors to companies. When you invest in a Mutual Fund, the fund manager buys shares of a company. This increases the capital for that company, which in turn will be used for expanding the business, research, or maintaining the current growth. All this will make the company successful, which is healthy for the economy as it leads to higher gross domestic product (GDP). Now imagine what would be the contribution of thousands of companies pooling money from mutual funds! ## Mutual funds in India vs other countries A Dutch Merchant created the first mutual fund ever in 1774 in Europe. He pooled money from investors and created a diversified fund of bonds. After that, mutual funds spread like wildfire from Europe to the UK and the US. Two and half centuries later, mutual funds are still one of the most popular investment options across the globe. Despite being late in the game (early 1960s), India's mutual fund industry is growing rapidly. But still, India\u2019s mutual fund market is underpenetrated. India\u2019s AUM to GDP ratio is only 16%, whereas the global average is around 75%. This shows there is a lot of scope for growth in this industry. As the masses slowly accept mutual funds, India's AUM to GDP ratio is also expected to improve over the years. ### Below are the rankings of countries whose AUM to GDP percentage is the highest in the world in 2020. Country| AUM to GDP (%)| Rank in the World ---|---|--- Luxembourg| 8330.59%| 1 Singapore| 998.32%| 2 Ireland| 957.79%| 3 Hong Kong| 575.72%| 4 Australia| 185.10%| 5 USA| 140.16%| 6 Netherlands| 126.62%| 7 Sweden| 104.54%| 8 Switzerland| 99.61%| 9 Canada| 97.56%| 10 India| 15.84%| 36 Source: TheGlobalEconomy.com ## History of Mutual funds in India Since its inception in 1963, the Indian Mutual Fund industry has undergone several changes. Broadly, sixty years (1963-2023) of the Mutual Fund industry can be divided into five phases, with each phase encouraging saving and investing. The first phase lasted for about 23 years and was entirely under the control of UTI, a government entity. In 1987, public sector banks first issued Mutual Funds, marking the beginning of the second phase. In six years (1987-1993), the AUM has grown by a CAGR of 38.4%, indicating an increase in acceptance and trust on the part of investors. The third phase, which lasted for ten years (1993-2003), is one of the important phases for the growth of mutual funds in India. The government allowed private sector companies to issue Mutual Funds. As a result, the number of Mutual Funds and the AUM went up dramatically. In the fourth phase (2003-2014), a global financial crisis hampered the Mutual Fund industry's growth which shook investor confidence. To re-establish investor confidence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a slew of measures in the fifth phase (Since 2014). SEBI's efforts paid off, and the Indian Mutual Fund industry witnessed steady inflows. As of January 31, 2023, the industry AUM stood at Rs 39.62 trillion with over 142 million folios and 62 million active SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) accounts. Although SEBI's regulatory measures helped this growth, the distributors, agents, and technology provided last-mile connectivity and expanded the retail investor base. ## Astounding facts about the mutual fund in India Indian Mutual Funds industry has undergone dramatic changes in the last sixty years to become one of the most talked about sectors in the world. Following are some of the most noteworthy facts about the Indian mutual funds' industry. 1. India is now the world's second-largest mutual fund industry, with over $400 billion in assets under management. 2. The Mutual Fund industry in India is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, with a CAGR growth of 17.5% over the past five years. 3. More than 46 million households have invested in Mutual Funds in India. 4. Although there are more than 40 Fund houses, the top 10 Fund houses or AMCs (Asset Management Companies) manage over 70% of the mutual fund assets in India. ## Biggest mutual fund scams in India Despite being one of the budding Mutual Fund markets in the world, the Indian Mutual Fund industry has witnessed several major scams. Following are some of the biggest scams in the Mutual Fund industry. ### UTI Scam The government set up the Unit Trust India (UTI) in 1963 to float and manage Mutual Funds. It had a monopoly for over 24 years until the government of India allowed public and private sector banks to launch their Mutual Fund schemes. Within 24 years of its monopoly, UTI built a huge investor base and handled assets worth Rs 67 billion (until 1988). UTI offered assured return schemes (ARS) to Mutual Fund investors, where it guaranteed fixed returns. However, it failed to set up an adequate guarantee. In other words, it didn't have enough capital to pay the assured returns to investors in case they withdrew their funds. Moreover, it sets the unit price arbitrarily at a price which was more than the value of actual assets. The scam came into the limelight in 2001 when the markets plummeted due to the Ketan Parekh scam and other factors. The scam shook investor confidence, and they wanted to redeem their investments from UTI assured return scheme. However, lack of capital put a strain on UTI, and it banned all redemptions for six months which affected retail investors in a big way. To add to this, the institutional investors on the UTI board withdrew their investments before the crisis came into the limelight. All this affected retail investors which led SEBI to tighten the rules of mutual funds. ### Franklin Templeton Scam Franklin Templeton is one of the oldest Mutual Fund companies in India. In April 2020, the lockdown led to a lack of liquidity in the markets. With people staying at home and all business operations coming to a sudden halt, the money supply was reduced. Due to this illiquidity the fund house announced the closure of six debt mutual fund schemes. The total assets of these six schemes were almost Rs 300 billion. The withdrawal of the six debt schemes affected over three lakh investors. Despite investing in low-risk debt schemes, investors lost their money. ### Axis Mutual Fund\u2019s Front-running Fraudulent Scheme One of the most recent scams in the Mutual Fund industry is the Axis Mutual Fund scam. Axis Mutual Fund, the seventh largest Fund house in the country, sacked two of its executives in May 2022 who might have engaged in front running. Front running is an act of trading stocks after being acquainted with some transaction information that will move the prices. This is considered illegal in India, and SEBI is investigating to dig deep into this. ## Mutual fund success stories Although several scams affected Mutual Fund investors, there are quite a few success stories as well. Many investors make a fortune by investing in Mutual Funds. Below are some of the oldest Mutual Funds in India that are performing well even today. Investors who invested in these Funds would\u2019ve accumulated a lot of wealth by now. **Franklin India Bluechip Fund** \u2013 This Fund is 30 years old and has given an average return of 19.34% since inception. Had you invested Rs 1 lakh during its inception, you would've made Rs 2.01 crores by now. **Franklin India Prima Fund** \u2013 This 30-year-old midcap Fund has given an average return of 18.88% per annum since inception. Investing Rs 1 lakh in 1993 would have been Rs 1.79 crores now. **HDFC Flexi cap** \u2013 This 28-year-old fund has given almost 18.04% return since its inception. This means that every year, the value of the fund grew by an average of 18%. So had you invested Rs 1 lakh in 1995 in this fund, it would be Rs 1.03 crores today. **HDFC TaxSaver** \u2013 This Fund was introduced in 1996 and has given an average return of 23.27% since its inception. Had you invested Rs 1 lakh in this fund 27 years ago, you would be sitting at a profit of Rs 2.82 crores (current value Rs 2.83 crores). ## Are Mutual Funds better than gold and real estate? Even today, real estate and gold are the most preferred investments by many, especially baby boomers and generation X. When these generations started investing, there weren\u2019t a lot of investment options available other than real estate and gold. Moreover, gold and real estate were considered wealth creators that lasted for generations. This could be why these two were the go-to investments. The current generation has no dearth of choices, and multiple investment options are available such as shares, Mutual Funds, currency, and private equity. Among these, the most popular one is Mutual Funds. Mutual Funds pool money from diverse investors and invest in equity and debt securities. The reason behind its popularity is that they fit into the middle-class budget. The minimum investment for Mutual Funds is just Rs 500, and setting aside such a small amount every month bodes well for the middle class. This isn't possible with gold and real estate. With gold prices climbing daily, investing in gold or buying gold jewellery is becoming a far-fetched dream. The same is the case with real estate. Buying a piece of land or investing in a house requires a huge sum of money. Although a home loan is an option, with rising interest rates, it could take years to repay the loan dues. Mutual Funds are superior to gold and real estate, even in terms of returns. Since Mutual Funds invest in marketable securities, the chances of making huge wealth in a few years are possible. However, this is not the case with gold and real estate, as these asset classes don't offer steep returns. In terms of liquidity, gold ranks ahead of Mutual Funds and real estate. However, Mutual Funds are quite liquid, and real estate has very low liquidity. With respect to risk, Mutual Funds are considered very risky as they invest in marketable securities. However, the risk is compensated with high returns. Gold and real estate are considered less risky than Mutual Funds as their value has only gone up with hardly any depreciation. Since each asset class has pros and cons, it is better to balance out a portfolio by spreading the investments across multiple asset classes. One can invest in both Mutual Funds and gold; however, the allocation depends on the risk tolerance levels of the investor. However, experts recommend investing a maximum of 10% in gold. This is because gold acts as an excellent hedge against market volatility. When it comes to real estate, it totally depends on the resources the investor has \u2013 a real estate is definitely an investment option if one has enough money to invest in it. ## Why should the young generation invest in Mutual Funds? The present young generation has endless opportunities to grow their money and wealth. This was never the case with previous generations, as all they had was a single-income job. However, the present generation has several income sources, and side hustling has become a routine. While working hard is one way to make more money, investing is a smart way to build long-term wealth. Investing helps build a financially secure future by making your money work for you. Investing from a young age will allow one to accumulate more money and reach all financial goals sooner than expected. Although there are several investment options available, Mutual Funds are quite popular. Several reasons contribute to this popularity, such as low minimum investment and monthly SIP breaking big financial goals into easily achievable instalments. Apart from this, the huge potential to give high returns long-term has made them an attractive choice for investors. Equity Mutual Funds have outperformed Fixed Deposits (FDs) in the last decade by 11% - 18%. They are expected to give a similar return in the future as well. With such high returns, it\u2019s no wonder that Mutual Funds have instilled confidence in the mind of investors, especially the middle class who prefer FDs. The current young generation has the one thing Mutual Funds need - time. Mutual Funds have always performed well in the long term. With an abundance of time, the current generation can accumulate a lot of wealth for themselves. Let's see how. early in life, the financial burden of saving is reduced. If you start investing Rs 1,000 per month from the age of 21 for 39 years at a below-average rate of 10% per annum, you can accumulate Rs 22.79 lakhs by the time you are 60. Imagine the corpus you can build by investing Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000 a month at a higher rate! So, if you are not investing at a young age, you are definitely missing out on time. However, assessing your recourses, goals, and risk tolerance levels is best before investing. Happy investing!

They suit investors with low-risk appetite or investors nearing retirement. These funds invest in both equity and debt securities and hence are hybrid in nature. However, their portfolio is more skewed towards low-risk debt instruments. Read to find out more about the best conservative mutual funds. ## What are Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds? According to SEBI, conservative hybrid mutual funds are open-ended funds that should invest 10-25% of their assets in equities and 75-90% of the assets in debt. On the one hand, they are relatively low-risk investments than pure equity funds. On the other hand, they give better returns than pure debt funds due to their limited exposure to equity. This could be why they are perfect for low-risk investors looking for predictable returns. They are ideal for an investment horizon of three years. The following are the features of conservative mutual funds: 1. **Returns:** These funds give better returns than fixed deposits and pure debt funds due to their exposure to equity. Moreover, they give predictable returns making them a good alternative to government securities. 2. **Risk:** Since these funds invest a majority of the assets in debt securities, they are considered low-risk investments. 3. **Asset allocation:** These funds invest 75-90% of the assets in low-risk investments like government securities, treasury bills, bonds, and debentures. The rest 10-25% is invested in large-cap stocks, which are well-established entities giving stable returns than mid-cap and small-cap companies. ## 10 Best Conservative Funds (Based on 3 Year Returns) Scheme Name| AuM (Cr)| 6 Month| YTD| 1 Year| 2 Year| 3 Year| 5 Year| 10 Year ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Sundaram Debt Oriented Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 30.03| 0.0057| -0.0049| 4.15%| 8.04%| 9.70%| 6.07%| 8.35% Axis Regular Saver Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 407.7| -0.0069| -0.0073| 2.12%| 5.66%| 9.66%| 6.90%| 8.90% DSP Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 199.29| 0.0109| -0.0019| 3.19%| 5.82%| 9.06%| 5.85%| 8.11% HSBC Conservative Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 122.02| 0.002| -0.0018| 2.59%| 5.51%| 8.88%| 7.40%| 8.44% Nippon India Hybrid Bond Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 716.19| 0.0222| 0.0056| 5.37%| 7.35%| 8.87%| 3.35%| 7.04% Franklin India Debt Hybrid Fund - Direct - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 246.57| 0.0088| -0.0041| 5.28%| 5.44%| 8.39%| 6.80%| 8.79% Baroda BNP Paribas Conservative Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 501.67| 0.007| -0.0003| 4.07%| 5.29%| 8.27%| 7.60%| 9.23% Navi Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 26.99| 0.007| -0.0074| 4.41%| 4.57%| 7.19%| 6.43%| 8.13% LIC MF Debt Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 61.5| 0.0013| -0.0045| 2.36%| 4.55%| 7.07%| 6.59%| 7.48% Bandhan Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund| 140.61| -0.0067| -0.0064| 1.25%| 3.20%| 6.34%| 5.94%| 8.04% Updated - As of March 14, 2023. ## How to Select the Best Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds to invest? When investing in conservative hybrid funds, you must consider the following factors. **Investment goal and horizon:** Before investing, it is important to understand your goals. First, see whether your goal is short-term or long-term. If your goal can be achieved in less than three years, it is a short-term goal; else, it is a long-term goal. Then determine in how many years you want to achieve it. This will help determine your investment horizon. For conservative funds, your ideal investment horizon is around three years. So for short-term goals, this could be your go-to fund. **Fund performance:** When selecting a fund for investment, check its performance. You cannot check the performance in isolation. It must be compared to the benchmark and its peers to see how well it is performing. Select funds that perform better than the benchmark and other funds in the category. **Risk-adjusted returns:** Besides checking the returns, it is important to check standard deviation, alpha, beta, Sharpe and Sortino ratio. The higher the alpha, Sharpe and Sortino ratio, the better the fund. Standard deviation is a measurement of risk and has to be on the lower side. Compare these ratios with the category average and the benchmark to see where the fund is standing with respect to others. **Costs:** Every fund has an expense ratio, which is the cost of managing the fund. The lower the expense ratio, the better, as the costs are deducted from the profits. Apart from this, the exit load is charged if you exit the fund before a specified time. Compare the costs with other funds and select the one with the least expenses. **Fund manager:** Fund managers play a crucial role with respect to the fund's performance. They decide the asset allocation of the fund, which impacts the returns. Hence it is best to choose a fund with experienced fund managers having a good track record. ## Advantages of Conservative Hybrid Funds 1. **Diversification:** Conservative hybrid funds invest in equity and debt securities, automatically providing diversification to the portfolio. While the investment in debt is high, giving principal protection, the little exposure to equity ensures better returns than debt funds. 2. **Low volatility:** These funds predominantly invest in debt securities, hence aren\u2019t exposed much to market volatility. When compared to equity funds, the risk in these funds is significantly low. Hence, they suit investors with low-risk tolerance. 3. **Better than FD returns:** Since they invest in debt and equity instruments, they give returns that are higher than fixed deposits. The debt portion safeguards the principal, and equity ensures capital appreciation. ## Limitations of Conservative Hybrid Funds 1. **Not risk-free:** Although conservative funds invest a majority of the assets in debt funds, they are not entirely risk-free. They are subject to default risk and interest rate risk. Default risk or credit risk is the risk of not receiving the principal amount. Interest rate risk is the fluctuation in interest rate causing volatility in the returns. Apart from this, the equity portion is exposed to market risks. 2. **Fund manager\u2019s expertise:** The fund's performance depends on the asset allocation which the fund manager decides. Hence, the fund's success depends on the fund manager. The fund manager must have enough expertise to manage both equity and debt investments. 3. **Low returns:** These funds give lower returns than pure equity or aggressive funds in a bullish market, as their exposure to equity is low. ## How are the best Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds taxed? Conservative funds are hybrid in nature, but they predominantly invest in debt securities. Hence for the purpose of taxation, they are treated as pure debt funds. The short-term capital gains are the gains earned if you redeem your investment before a period of three years from the date of investment. They are taxed at the investor's income tax slab rate. The long-term capital gains are earned after a period of three years from the date of investment and are taxed at 20% with an indexation benefit. Indexation benefit factors inflation when applying taxes to your capital gains. In other words, since inflation reduces the actual returns, the effect of inflation on the returns is considered before applying taxes. Due to the indexation benefit, the overall taxes to be paid comes down. ## Who Should Invest in Conservative Hybrid Funds? As the name suggests, conservative hybrid funds are for low-risk investors looking for inflation-beating returns with capital preservation. These are ideal for such investors as they invest majorly in debt securities. These funds also suit investors with an investment horizon of three years. The investment in equity is very low; hence, three years is enough time for the debt securities to mature, along with slight capital appreciation from equities. For investors nearing their long-term goals, conservative funds can be an excellent option as they have low risk and require a minimum investment horizon. Investors can switch from equity to conservative funds to preserve their gains and slowly withdraw them through a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) to fulfil their financial goals. ## How to invest in Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds? You can invest in conservative hybrid funds through online and offline modes. **Offline:** You can directly approach an investment advisor who will take care of your investments. Alternatively, you can invest on your own by visiting the office of the mutual fund you select. Remember to do your due diligence before selecting a fund for investment. **Online:** You can invest online through the asset management company's website or app or invest through a mutual fund platform. Several platforms offer regular and direct plans, and you have to choose the one you are comfortable with and start investing. Jupiter Money is an online platform where you can invest in mutual funds within minutes from the comfort of your home. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### How long should I stay invested in conservative hybrid mutual funds? There is no fixed tenure for conservative hybrid funds, but it's best to stay invested for a minimum of three years to reap maximum benefits. If you want to invest for a longer period, select an equity fund to draw the maximum potential of your money. ### Where do the best conservative hybrid mutual funds invest? The best conservative mutual funds invest in debt securities like bonds and debentures and government securities like treasury bills. They also invest in large-cap companies, which are well-established entities having slightly lower risk than mid-cap and small-cap companies. ### What kind of returns can I earn from conservative hybrid funds? On average, you can earn 8-10% returns from conservative hybrid mutual funds. If you want to earn a higher return, then you must take a higher risk and invest in pure equity funds. ### Are conservative mutual funds low-risk? Yes, conservative mutual funds are low-risk investments as they invest in debt securities. Debt securities give fixed, and predictable returns and hence conservative funds are considered low-risk investments. ### Are conservative hybrid funds safe? Conservative funds have low risk but are not entirely safe. They are exposed to default risk, interest rate risk, and market risk. Default risk is the risk of not receiving money from the debtor. Interest rate risk is the effect of interest rate fluctuations on a fund's return. Lastly, market risk is the risk of market volatility on the fund. Since conservative funds invest in equity and debt, they are exposed to these three kinds of risks. However, they are slightly less risky than aggressive and pure equity funds.

The National Pension System (NPS), previously known as National Pension Scheme, is an investment instrument offered by the Central Government. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the NPS, ensuring maximum security. You may invest in NPS regularly during your working years and create substantial wealth for retirement. Once you retire, a portion of the accumulated maturity amount will become available for withdrawal. And you will receive the rest as a monthly pension. Any Indian resident can invest in NPS. You can benefit from this pension scheme if you are a government, private or unorganized sector employee. But, before investing in NPS, you must learn how the scheme works. To understand this, use an NPS calculator online to get an idea about the returns the scheme can generate. ## **The benefits of NPS** NPS has become a popular investment avenue over the last few years due to its substantial returns and security. The scheme offers many other benefits that make it a suitable investment option for everyone. Here are five noteworthy advantages of NPS. **1\\. High returns** When investing to build a retirement fund, your focus should be to earn high returns. And NPS can offer that as it has historically provided 8% to 10% annual interest for more than a decade. When you invest in NPS, the fund managers put a portion of the money in equity-based investment options. That is how NPS generates higher returns than most other tax-saving schemes. Additionally, if you are not satisfied with the returns, the scheme allows you to change the fund manager as well. **2\\. Stabilized risk** Equity-linked investment products are generally risky as market volatility can affect their returns. But NPS is a safe option as the scheme systematically stabilizes the risk. If you are a government employee, NPS allows you to invest only up to 50% of your total fund in equities. The limit is between 50% and 70% for non-government employees. After you reach 50 years, the scheme\u2019s equity exposure automatically starts to reduce by 2.5% every year. If you are 60 years or more, the equity exposure limit will become fixed at 50%. This systematic stabilization balances risk and returns, ensuring that your money is safe. If all these seem too complicated, you can use a National Pension Scheme calculator. It will quickly give you a maturity amount estimation without any hassles. **3\\. Tax benefits** One benefit of NPS that makes it lucrative is the tax deductions it offers. The contributions you and your employer make towards NPS are tax-deductible up to \u20b91.5 lakhs. The self-contributed amount is tax exemptible under subsection 80CCD (1) of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The deduction limit is 10% of your salary or \u20b91.5 lakhs, whichever is lower. The tax benefit for the employer\u2019s contribution is covered under Section 80CCD (2). If you are self-employed, the tax deduction limit is 20% of your gross income under subsection 80CCD (1). But you will not get any exemption under Section 80CCD (2). Under Section 80CCD (2), the tax deduction limit is whichever is the lowest from the following. * Employer\u2019s NPS contribution * Total gross income * 10% of basic pay and Dearness Allowance (DA) Additionally, Section 80CCD (1B) allows a tax deduction of up to \u20b950,000 on your contribution to the NPS account. So, you can get a total tax exemption of up to \u20b92 lakhs using the benefits offered by Sections 80CCD (1) and 80CCD (1B). **4\\. Emergency withdrawal** You may withdraw up to 60% of your accumulated NPS fund after the age of 60 years. You will get the remaining amount as pension paid on a regular basis from an insurance firm registered under PFRDA. Moreover, the withdrawn amount is tax-exempted. It is always advisable to stay invested in the NPS until you retire, allowing your money to grow into significant wealth. But NPS allows you to withdraw up to 25% of the fund for emergency purposes after staying invested for at least three years. The reasons for withdrawal can be medical treatment for yourself or your family, buying or building a house, higher education or wedding of children, and other purposes. You can withdraw the money three times during the investment tenure with a minimum gap of five years between each withdrawal. **5\\. Equity allocation flexibility** The Scheme E of NPS lets you invest up to 50% of the money in equity-based options. You may decide between active and auto choices for equity investments. If you select the former, you will have the freedom to decide how much to invest in equities within the set limit. The latter decides the equity contributions as per your age. The older you get, the lower will be the equity allocation, thereby reducing risk. ## The formula for calculating the NPS amount NPS offers compound interest like any other high-return investment product. You can use an NPS calculator to determine how much return you can expect from your investment within seconds. But, if you want to understand how the calculation works, it is important to learn the NPS formula, which uses multiple components: * **_A_** : Maturity amount * ** _P_** : Principal amount invested * ** _r_** : Annual interest rate * ** _n_** : Number of times the interest is compounded * ** _t_** : Tenure of investment Based on the above components, the formula is A = P x (1 + r/n) n.t Let us understand the formula with the help of an example. Suppose you are presently 34 years old and decide to start contributing \u20b93,000 a month to the NPS account. If you get an interest rate of 10% during the investment tenure of 26 years, the maturity amount will be \u20b944.35 lakhs for a total contribution of \u20b99.36 lakhs. Using an NPS return calculator, you can determine the expected profit based on your age and monthly investment. ## How to use the NPS calculator The NPS calculator is quick and easy to use with the following five steps. 1. Mention the amount you wish to contribute under the \u201cHow much do you want to invest per month?\u201d section. 2. Adjust the slider under \u201cYour Current Age\u201d to input your age. 3. Adjust the slider under \u201cWhat Is Your Expected Rate of Return?\u201d to input the interest rate of NPS. 4. Adjust the slider under \u201cWhat Percent Do You Wish to Invest in Annuity?\u201d to mention the percentage of the total contribution you want to be invested in annuity. 5. Adjust the slider under \u201cHow Many Years Do You Wish to Invest?\u201d to provide the investment tenure. After you provide the details based on your requirements, the NPS pension calculator will show your total investment, lump-sum value, annuity value, and total maturity amount. ## Where to invest: NPS vs. PPF Public Provident Fund (PPF) and NPS both are popular investment options in India, especially among people who want to build a substantial retirement fund. The choice depends on your investment goals and risk appetite. Both PPF and NPS offer a variety of benefits but also have fundamental differences. Below table shows a comparative analysis of both the options to help you make an informed decision. **_Criteria_** | **_NPS_** | **_PPF_** ---|---|--- Rate of return | Historically provided 8% to 10% interest. | The current interest rate offered is 7.1%. The government decides it quarterly. Lock-in period | Until retirement | 15 years Risk associated | Minimum risk as the scheme controls it systematically. But NPS is linked to the market. So, it is not completely risk-free. | No risk as the investment is not linked to the market. Tax benefits | Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers a tax deduction of up to \u20b91.5 lakhs on your contribution. Another \u20b950,000 of tax deduction is available under Section 80CCD(1B). | You can get a tax deduction of up to \u20b91.5 lakhs on your investment under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. As you can see from the above information, NPS has the potential to offer higher maturity benefits. So, if you are willing to take a little risk, NPS will help you build a more sizable retirement fund than PPF. ## How does the NPS work?

The amount would be subtracted from their overall gross income to determine the individual's taxable income. The Income Tax Act's Section 80C authorizes this deduction. The following requirements must be met to claim this deduction: * Only those who are members of Hindu United Families (or HUF) and individuals are permitted to invest in fixed deposit plans that offer tax benefits. * The minimum amount that the bank specifies for the Fixed Deposit is permissible. * The 5-year lock-in term applies to the tax-saving fixed deposits. Loans and premature withdrawals from the fixed deposit are prohibited. * People may invest in such Fixed Deposits through any commercial or public sector bank. Cooperative and rural banks cannot enjoy these benefits. * Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961 permits deductions for Post Office Time Deposits with terms of five years. * Transfers between post offices are permitted for Post Office Fixed Deposits. * Fixed Deposits may be held sporadically or collectively. The initial holder of the joint fixed deposit will receive the tax benefit in this scenario. * Tax Deductible at Source (TDS) would be applicable since the interest earned on such Fixed Deposits is taxable according to the investor's tax bracket. The investment will pay interest monthly or quarterly, and this interest could be reinvested. * There is a nomination provision for Tax Deductible Fixed Deposits. * On these Fixed Deposits, banks give senior citizens comparatively greater interest rates. For Fixed Deposits with Tax Savings, there is a higher interest rate. ## How to avoid TDS on fixed deposits? All interest income produced in India, including interest from FDs, is subject to Tax Deducted at Source (or TDS). If the account holder or FD applicant\u2019s interest income for any financial year exceeds Rs. 10,000, they are legally required to pay tax. However, the account holder would not be required to pay tax if the earned interest is lower than Rs. 10,000. The following are some of the factors that one needs to be aware of to avoid TDS on fixed deposits: * **Self-declaration:** Please file form 15G or 15H, as appropriate, if the combined amount of taxable income produced in the financial year and the interest gained from FDs does not exceed the allowed taxable limit. * **Which form to fill out:** Form 15H would be for senior citizens, whereas Form 15G is intended for the general public. The applicant must be an Indian citizen aged 60 years or younger whose income does not exceed the applicable tax threshold. Only Indian residents over the age of 60 and those whose income is below the specified tax threshold may complete Form 15H. * **Managing your investments better:** Investing can be done so long as it doesn't cost more than Rs. 10,000 each year. For instance, the financial year could be split in half by investing in a one-year fixed-rate bond in October. You can avoid paying TDS upon your investment because the fiscal year ends on March 31. * **Waiving off of TDS for the second applicant:** Upon the primary account holder's death, the second account holder (or the second applicant) can operate the joint account.TDS will be automatically withheld from your account when you are the former applicant for a joint FD and your interest income is in excess of the permitted amount. TDS is not likely to be taken out of a joint account if you are the subsequent applicant. * **Distribution of investments:** Instead of placing all of their money in one bank, investors can spread their investments over several banks. * **PAN:** For your FD investment, the bank must receive your PAN information. Banks typically charge TDS at a greater rate of 20% if you don't provide your PAN information. * **Late submissions:** The Income Tax authorities would issue a refund if the account holder files tax returns even though you failed to submit the necessary self-declaration forms and the TDS was deducted. However, you will be required to wait until July of the following year, and it will take a few more months for the reimbursement to be finalised. ## Conclusion Due to their assured returns and lack of financial risk, FDs continue to rank among the most popular investment options. Instead of paying high taxes, taking all required measures to undertake tax planning and managing your money more effectively is crucial. In addition to the techniques previously described, if one makes further investments, one may be able to claim tax exemption, which will assist lessen the tax overburden on the person to some extent.

Mutual funds offer good returns but have a risk element. Due to market volatility and dependent conditions, you can expect a roller-coaster investment journey. That means a fund or index\u2019s past performance cannot be considered a future indicator of its performance. However, this does not mean you need to shy away from investing. You can get good returns on your mutual funds by managing the associated risks. For instance, you should be aware of how to invest for maximum gains at minimum risk. Active and passive investing are two investing types that you can apply to get the best from your investments. Both types compare gains across common benchmark indices. Actively managed funds follow a direct investing approach. A passively managed fund tries to follow the performance of a specific benchmark index. Continue reading this article to understand the differences between actively and passively managed funds and to evaluate the best strategy for you to achieve your investment goals. ## **What are Actively Managed Funds?** Actively managed funds are funds that are directly managed by dedicated fund managers with expertise in market analysis and research. The active investing strategy aims at gaining revenue by outperforming certain index returns or benchmark indices through frequent trading. Equity funds, debt, and hybrid mutual funds are popular examples of active funds. You can undertake active investing yourself or through professionals via actively managed funds and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ## **What are Passively Managed Funds?** Passive funds are not actively managed by a fund manager. They are managed to follow the performance of a standard index to maximize returns. For example, the passive fund- Nifty BeES tracks the benchmark Nifty 50 Index to duplicate the benchmark's performance and translate it into returns. ETFs and index funds are common passively managed funds. ETFs are funds that aim to duplicate the pattern of a particular stock index. ### What is Benchmark? Benchmark refers to an index/standard for measuring the overall performance of a mutual fund. The benchmark provides information on how much your investment should have earned compared to actual returns earned. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are the two benchmark indices in the Indian stock markets. Normally, a mutual fund house decides a certain fund's benchmark index. In an ideal market scenario, mutual funds should try to match their benchmark returns. ## **How Do Actively Managed Funds Work?** For actively managed funds, the fund managers take all relevant decisions regarding the underlying securities to generate revenue by beating a particular benchmark index. Such decisions include tracking the market performance, individual stock performance, analyzing your portfolio investments, and so on. So, there is a lot of detailed market research and analysis required before selecting the desired stock holdings. A fund manager frequently trades in active funds to generate the maximum return on your portfolio investment. ## **How Does a Passively Managed Fund Work?** A passively managed fund works on purchasing and holding securities through various market conditions to achieve the desired returns over the long term. There is no active decision-making involved. A passive fund manager attempts to follow the performance of passive funds like ETFs and Index Funds against benchmark indices. Minimal trading is conducted to generate maximum long-term returns. If the benchmark index changes, the passive fund manager makes adjustments accordingly. They realign your passive funds to follow the performance of the benchmark index. Such fund realignment could include purchasing or selling stocks to match the revised benchmark index performance. ## Differences Between Actively Managed Funds and Passively Managed Funds Parameters| Active Funds| Passive Funds ---|---|--- Management Style| 1\\. The fund manager has the right to select and time trades, including buying, holding, selling, and weighing the investments 2\\. Fund managers undertake active and detailed research and look for various investments opportunities before investing| 1\\. Passive fund managers are not actively involved. 2\\.

Active funds have higher expense ratios than passive funds 2\\. Actively managed funds require more in-depth research, analysis, and trading than passive funds| 1\\. Passive funds are cheaper compared to active funds as they have few transactions 2\\. Passive investing does not require in-depth market analysis daily as it tries to replicate a benchmark index to optimise returns over time. So, fewer transactions lead to lower costs. Risk| 1\\. Riskier than passive funds 2\\. Actively managed funds focus on individual securities 3\\. Active funds like equity funds try to beat the benchmark index in a volatile market, so the chances of returns and risk are high.| 1\\. Less risky compared to active investing 2\\. Passive investing strategies focus on the overall fund performance 3\\. You can easily diversify your portfolio across a wide range of stocks and bonds like index funds and ETFs4\\. A diversified portfolio reduces the risk of loss Transparency| 1\\. Active funds are less transparent than passive funds 2\\. Fund managers do not disclose their investment approach owing to competition 3\\. Investors cannot know how their money is invested| 1\\. Passive investing is more transparent than active investing 2\\. An index gets tracked against its benchmark index. 3\\. Investors can track the fund's performance Tax Efficiency| 1\\. They are less tax efficient than passively managed funds 2\\. Actively managed funds involve higher buying and selling transactions in the fund. 3\\. Thus, they generate higher capital gain distributions meaning more capital gain tax to be paid by investors| 1\\. More tax efficient than actively managed funds 2\\. Passive investing involves fewer trading transactions within the index fund 3\\. So, fewer capital gains are generated, leading to less tax on capital gains for investors ## Which are Better\u2014Actively Funds or Passive Funds? There is no one best investment strategy. It all depends on the investor\u2019s goals, funds available, tenure, and risk appetite. If you have a high-risk appetite and want higher returns over the short term, you could consider actively managed funds. However, as all mutual funds are subject to market risk, there are no guaranteed returns. If you prefer low-risk investments with a long-term investment horizon, then a passively managed fund would be the right strategy for you. You could also consider both investment strategies. ## Signing Off Both actively and passively managed funds aim to maximise investor returns. However, they differ in certain respects. For instance, a passively managed fund offers safety and diversification, while actively managed funds may generate higher returns over the short term. Based on your investment goals, risk-taking, commitment, and investment horizon, you could select between the two strategies. **Note:**_The content in this article is not a piece of financial advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions._ ## FAQs ### 1\\. Are mutual funds actively or passively managed funds? Mutual funds can be both passively and actively managed. ### 2\\. What makes actively managed funds attractive to investors? Investors invest in actively managed funds for their potential to beat their benchmark. Also, actively managed funds have key strategies to complement your portfolio\u2019s index funds, thus maximising your returns. ### 3\\. Are actively managed funds worth the risk? Actively managed funds are ideal for investors who want high returns from their investments, as active fund managers try to invest in funds that can beat their benchmarks. ### 4\\. Is passive investing cheaper than active investing? In a passively managed fund, the fund managers do not decide which securities to invest in. In active investing, a fund manager has to undertake in-depth research and analyse opportunities before investing in funds involving costs. So, passive investing is cheaper than active investing.

The profits are distributed by the companies to the shareholders in the form of dividends. In simple words, dividends are the profits distributed to the shareholders of the company. Let\u2019s understand them in detail and what happens to the unclaimed dividends of the shareholders. ## How Do Dividends Work? In India, the company's distribution of dividends is regulated by the Companies Act, 2013. Once the company earns profits, it may decide to distribute dividends to the shareholders. The dividends are usually denoted as a percentage of the face value of shares. For instance, if a company decides to distribute a 10% dividend and the face value of its shares is Rs. 100, then it will pay Rs. 10 per share as a dividend to the shareholders. However, in certain situations, the company pays the dividend, but the shareholders do not claim it. The dividend is to be paid by the company on demand and therefore is its liability. If the shareholder does not claim dividends within seven years, then such unclaimed dividends shall be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) account. However, the shareholder has the right to claim the unclaimed dividend at any point in time. ## Types of Dividend The following are the different types of dividends that a company may pay to its shareholders: ### Final dividend The final dividend is paid to the shareholders after the end of every financial year. It is proposed by the board of directors and approved by the shareholders in the general meeting. Final dividends are paid after the finalisation of the annual accounts of the company. ### Interim dividend The dividend paid between two general meetings of the company is called the interim dividend. It can be paid at any time between the two general meetings. However, companies usually prefer to pay interim dividends after declaring their quarterly results. The two types of dividends paid by the companies are described above. However, it is not necessary that the dividends always be paid in cash. The following are the ways in which the dividend is paid to the shareholders of the company: * **Cash dividend:** Cash dividends are one of the most common types of dividends, and most companies prefer to pay their dividends by directly crediting the amount in the shareholder\u2019s bank accounts. However, for large companies with numerous shareholders, it is important to have the required liquidity to pay dividends in cash. * **Stock dividends:** These are usually given in the form of the issue of shares to the shareholders. Also known as the issue of bonus shares, here, the companies usually allot more shares to the shareholders at a predetermined ratio based on the existing shares. For instance, a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:2 implies that the company will issue 1 share for every 2 shares held by the shareholders. * **Property dividend:** Companies can issue non-monetary dividends to the shareholders by distributing their assets. A property dividend or asset dividend is usually distributed when the company no longer requires an asset and wants to distribute it to the shareholders. In India, usually, dividends are distributed in cash or through the issue of bonus shares. ## Advantages and Disadvantages of Dividend There are advantages as well as disadvantages to dividend payments, both to the company and shareholders. If the company decides to retain the profits instead of distributing them as dividends, it can compound those profits. However, if the company decides to pay dividends to the shareholders, there will be an outflow of resources from its books. Dividends are paid from the company's reserves, which form part of equity. Distributing dividends leads to a reduction in the company's equity value as it directly reduces the reserves that the company is holding. For shareholders, dividend payments are a source of passive income. However, if the company retains the profits, it can lead to compounding and exponential growth in its share value. ## Impact of Dividends on Share Prices Once the company declares the dividend, it also declares a record date. All the shareholders holding shares on the record date are eligible to receive the dividend. Therefore, investors, in order to book extra income in the form of a dividend, start buying shares of such a company. The price of such shares starts to increase, and investors are even ready to pay a premium to buy them. However, once the record date expires, further investors won\u2019t be eligible to receive the dividend. As a result, there is a fall in the share price because investors are no longer willing to pay a premium price for the shares. ## Dividend Payout Ratio vs. Dividend Yield Ratio Most often, people confuse the dividend payout ratio with the dividend yield ratio. However, there is a clear difference between the two. The dividend payout ratio indicates the portion of the company\u2019s earnings being paid to the shareholders as dividends. The dividend yield ratio indicates the rate of return that shareholders earn on their investments. The following are the formulae for these terms: **Dividend Payout Ratio =** Annual Dividends Per Share / Earnings Per Share **Dividend Yield Ratio =** Annual Dividends Per Share / Price Per Share Let\u2019s understand this with a practical example: If the earnings per share are Rs. 1000 and the annual dividend of the company is Rs. 100, then the dividend payout ratio is 10%. Further, suppose you have invested Rs. 2000 in a company\u2019s shares, and you receive a dividend of Rs. 100 per share. Then the dividend yield ratio for you shall be 5%. ## Dividend vs. Buyback In both dividend and buyback, the shareholders receive the payment from the company. However, there is a difference between both. A dividend is when a company shares profits with its shareholders, while a buyback is when the company buys back its shares from the shareholders. Both these steps are taken by the company when it has excess liquidity and has earned good profits. ## Chronology of Dividend Issue From declaration to payment, issuing dividends is a four-step process. The following dates are prominent when it comes to the declaration and payment of dividends: * **Dividend declaration date:** This is the date when companies declare their dividends. * **Dividend record date:** Dividends are paid to the shareholders whose names appear in the list of shareholders on the record date. * **Ex-dividend date:** Ex-divided date is when all the newly purchased and sold shares are not entitled to the dividend declared. * **Dividend payment date:** This is the date when the dividend is paid to the shareholders. ## Best Dividend-Paying Stocks of 2023 As discussed earlier, not all companies pay dividends to shareholders. You can invest in dividend-paying stocks if you want to earn a good passive income. The following are some of the best dividend-paying stocks of 2022: * Britannia Industries * Punjab National Bank * Balkrishna Industries * Dr. Lal PathLabs * Dalmia Bharat * Polycab India * Indian Hotels Company * Happiest Minds Technologies ## In a Nutshell Dividend-paying stocks are a preferred investment avenue among investors. They provide a passive income, and their capital appreciation contributes to wealth creation. Further, investors can also go with dividend-paying mutual funds if they are new to investing or cannot put in adequate time in researching stocks. Dividend-paying mutual funds invest in high dividend-paying companies. If you are keen on investing in stocks, understand the category under which the stock falls and the implications of dividends beforehand. Note: this article is not a piece of investment advice. Professional consultation prior to making any significant investment decisions is highly advised. ## Frequently asked questions ### Do dividends attract income tax? Yes. Earlier, the dividend income was exempt in the hands of the shareholders because the companies used to pay the dividend distribution tax (DDT). However, in February 2020, DDT was abolished, and now investors are liable to pay tax on their dividend income. ### Within how many days shall the company pay dividend after its declaration? The company shall pay dividends within 30 days of the company's declaration. ### What is the tax rate applicable to dividend income? The dividends shall be taxed at the rate applicable to the taxpayers. Therefore, if you fall into the 20% tax bracket, you will pay tax at the same rate on your dividend income. ### What is the difference between unclaimed and unpaid dividends? The unclaimed dividend is the dividend paid by the company but not claimed by the shareholders. However, if the company does not pay a dividend after announcing it, then it is known as an unpaid dividend. ### Is unclaimed dividend an asset or a liability?

More people are actively showing interest in investments. As per a survey reported by the , 2 in 5 families are likely to invest in equities or mutual funds. Out of the population surveyed, 10% showed interest in equity investing, while 31% showed interest in mutual fund investment. Interestingly, mutual funds also tend to invest in equity instruments. Let\u2019s decode everything you need to know about equity investments. ## Equity vs. Non-Equity Investments When it comes to investment, investment instruments can be broadly classified into equity and non-equity investments. ### Equity Investments This encompasses investments in equity instruments. Equity instruments are basically the equity shares issued by companies to raise capital from the public. Equity investments comprise investments in either the listed shares or unlisted shares, the former being predominant. Listed shares trade on recognised stock exchanges like National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. ### Non-Equity Investments This comprises investment in instruments other than equity instruments. This can include all other investment avenues like bonds, fixed deposits, gold, real estate, or even crypto investments. ## Types of Equity Investments You would be happy to know that there are multiple types available to investors for investing in equity instruments. This includes: * **Equity Shares:** This is when you directly invest in equity shares of the company (discussed in detail later). * **Equity funds:** This involves investing in those funds that invest in equity**** shares of the company (discussed in detail later). * **Futures:** Futures are one type of derivative instrument. It derives its value from the underlying asset, which can be equity shares, currency or commodities as well. Investors can trade in equity futures as part of their equity investment strategy. * **Options:** Options are also a type of derivative instrument. Options give the option holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset. Here also, the underlying asset can be equity shares, currency, or commodities. ## What Are Equity Shares? As stated earlier, equity shares are the instruments used by companies to raise capital. While for the company, it is a method of financing, for investors, it is an instrument to invest and earn returns. Equity shares represent a unit or part ownership in the company. The entire share capital of the company can be divided into units of small denominations. These units are known as equity shares. ## What are Equity Funds? Funds are nothing but pooling money from various investors and investing it in the underlying asset as per the terms of the fund. These are commonly known as mutual funds. Equity funds are that category of mutual funds that invest in equity shares issued by companies. Equity funds can be classified into different categories based on the type of equity shares in which the funds are invested. This can include dividend funds, growth funds, small-cap funds, mid-cap funds, large-cap funds, etc. ## Risks Associated With Equity Investments Equity investments are one of the most profitable and return-generating investment avenues. When you invest in equity, you are investing in the company that has issued those equity shares. Therefore, equity investments also come with certain associated risks. This include: * **Market Risk:** This is the biggest risk of investing in equity instruments. As equity shares are traded in the market, they are volatile. Multiple factors affect the prices of equity shares like demand (buyers), supply (sellers), political scenarios, macroeconomic factors, government policies, etc. * **Financial Risk:** As stated earlier, investing in equity shares means investing in the company. This creates a financial risk for equity investors. If there is a disruption in the profitability or business of the company, then ultimately, its share price will drop, and the shareholders will suffer a loss. * **Liquidity Risk:** This shows how easily you can convert your equity investments into cash by selling them at or near their market value. Listed securities are highly liquid as you can sell your shares anytime during trading hours and withdraw your money. However, if you are investing in unlisted equity shares, then you need to consider whether the investment is liquid or not. This is because you may have to find buyers for your shares, unlike listed shares being sold in the stock market. * **Settlement Risk:** This can happen when the seller does not deliver equity securities after receiving money, or the cash is not received after delivering the security. Conducting transactions through the stock exchange can help avoid such risks. * **Currency Risk:** Investors face currency risk when they invest in equity shares of foreign companies. While your native currency is INR, you can invest in US companies in $. Thus any currency fluctuation will ultimately increase or reduce your gains or losses. ## How to Lower Risk in Equity Investments? ### To lower risk on equity investments, investors can follow the below-mentioned tips: * Do thorough research about the company and the industry before investing. * Activate stop loss to minimize your loss. * Derivatives like futures and options involve more risk than equities. Therefore, you should trade in them only after obtaining thorough knowledge. * If you are not investing for a longer term, then timing the market is important. You need to enter and exit the market at the right time to book profits. ## Equity Shares Vs. Equity Funds While equity shares involve direct investment in the shares of the company, equity funds involve investing in multiple equity shares at the same time. This reduces the overall risk as your investment is diversified between multiple equity shares. Further, equity funds are professionally managed by expert fund managers. Thus, new investors can benefit from their expertise. Seasoned investors often go for direct equity investment as they have thorough investment knowledge. ## Who Should Make Equity Investments? Those investors who are looking to earn good returns and have moderate to high-risk appetites can go for equity investments. If you are new to investing world, then you can go for equity funds as they are less risky as compared to direct equity investments. Further, you don\u2019t need to worry much about the selection of stocks as this is handled by expert fund managers. ## In a Nutshell Equity investments are gaining popularity among investors. In today\u2019s time, when inflation is skyrocketing, it is important to invest in avenues that provide above-inflation returns. Traditional investment avenues are unable to meet such high return benchmarks, and therefore, equities are looked upon by investors to grow their wealth.

However, investing is tricky and has its ups and downs due to the volatile nature of the market. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of fund that holds several profitable assets rather than only one. Income funds are a type of ETF or mutual fund that increase current income in periodic intervals. Income funds hold a variety of fixed-income securities like government and corporate bonds, dividend-paying stocks (a company\u2019s profit share that is paid to its shareholders), and money market instruments (liquid instruments that provide fixed returns with a maturity turnover of less than a year). They do not focus on helping you earn money from selling off your investment at a higher price. Rather, they help you earn a consistent income from your investments. Money market mutual funds (MMMFs) are intended for investors looking to park their cash or cash equivalent assets for a short period. They include treasury bills, banker\u2019s acceptance, and certificates of deposit that financial institutions like banks use to raise money for the short term. Though not as safe as cash, they are considered comparatively lower risk than other options. The biggest advantage of investing in these income funds is their liquidity. You can sell them anytime as there is no fixed investment period. However, they are not suitable for long-term investments. ## Who Should Invest in Income Funds? Income fund investment yields return by compounding over a certain period. The change in interest rates and the investment period considerably affects its gains. This makes income funds a suitable option for those willing to take high risks and those just looking to amplify their retirement income. Income funds, as the name suggests, help generate income from investments. People with a regular income prefer income funds as a viable retirement option. Income funds are more of an added source of income for some. ## Benefits of Investing in Income Funds For all the right reasons, income funds have emerged as a popular choice among investors. Some benefits of investing in income funds are as follows: ### \u00b7 Lower Risk There is a considerable risk in every form of investment. If you invest in income funds, you will lose some money if the credit rating goes down or the interest rates drop. However, income funds invest in a combination of bond funds and equity funds. There is a higher risk component in equity income funds. Government bonds or corporate bonds with high credit ratings are one of the most secure forms of investment. They carry a sovereign guarantee, meaning the issuing body is liable to repay the money as per the stipulated terms since the government issued them. ### \u00b7 High Liquidity Unlike fixed-income instruments, income funds can also be invested in the short term. However, you will see better returns in a longer investment period. The fund managers actively look for opportunities to sell income funds and optimise the returns. In such scenarios, income funds generate a higher profit than bank deposits. ### \u00b7 Better Returns over a Longer Period Since income funds generate lower returns than equity funds, it is recommended that you lock in the money for a longer period. A longer investment period generates a much higher return. However, income funds allow you to choose your desired investment period. ### \u00b7 Tax Benefit Unlike bank fixed deposits, debt bonds are not taxed every year. If you are in the highest tax bracket, you will save some money on tax as long-term capital gains up to Rs. 1 Lakh are tax-free. If equities are sold before a year, and the capital gain is more than 1 lakh rupees, you will be taxed 15% plus 4% cess. ### \u00b7 Diversification Income fund managers invest in a variety of fixed-income instruments. Some of these, like government bonds, cannot be purchased by retail investors. You will need the help of fund managers, who act as a medium to issue these bonds. A diversified portfolio lowers the market risk significantly. ## Fees and Charges of Income Funds Fund houses charge a small percentage of money from your investments to pay their employees and cover other investor purchases, redemption charges, and exchange costs. These are called \u2018Shareholder fees\u2019 and are always mentioned in the fund\u2019s prospectus. But, most fund houses have their assets to take care of their expenses. While they do not charge investors directly for this, you will pay a certain portion of this money under the section \u2018Annual Fund Operating Expenses.\u2019 \u2018Annual Fund Operating Expenses\u2019 cover management costs, distribution charges, and other expenses. Different fund houses charge different amounts of money. The expense ratio may seem like a small percentage of money at the beginning, but over time, the compound interest effect will take away a significant portion of your profits. You can directly invest in mutual funds through online investment platforms if you do not want to pay for these commissions. ## Working of Income Funds An income fund is an asset allocation fund that provides income from investments. Fund managers invest in companies that return their profits in cash to the issuer. It is different from growth funds in the respect that growth funds re-invest the generated profits to grow their pool of capital. Even so, the accumulated funds in income funds generate returns due to the compounding effect over an investment period. The value of income funds is regulated by interest rates and credit ratings. The share prices of income funds fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. When choosing income funds, you should focus on investment-grade income funds. Investment-grade ratings are a system of qualifiers that determine whether a bond is at low risk of default. These credit ratings express a futuristic outlook on an entity\u2019s capability to meet its financial commitments as and when they are due. AAA is the highest credit rating that can be assigned to an issuer\u2019s bonds. ## Conclusion Income funds are popular mutual funds that can generate consistent monthly revenue for their investors. However, it maximises the current income. It is subject to interest rate and market risk. The two key factors that you must zero in on are the risk level and expense ratio of a fund. While it may be tempting to only invest in the funds that have generated maximum returns in the past few years, you must evaluate how long the company has been functional and compare its returns in the last 10 years. Income funds are not known for building wealth. But, income funds with an investment period of over 10 years generate considerable returns. ## FAQs ### Are income funds better than individual stocks? If you do not have the luxury of time and knowledge to analyse daily market fluctuations, it is better to invest in income funds for a supplementary income source later in life. Income funds generate good profits over a longer investment period. Hence, they also carry minimal risk. ### Can I lose money in income funds? Like every other investment, income fundsare also subject to interest rates and market risk. If credit ratings interest rates fall, the value of an equity fund or corporate bond will also suffer. However, it is quite unlikely that you will lose all your money. ### How many types of income funds are there? There are two kinds of bond funds: government and corporate. Government funds carry no individual risk and are the safest choice for investors in times of crisis. Comparatively, corporate bonds carry a threat of the issuer being unable to pay the principal amount and are subject to some market risks. ### Are credit ratings important for income funds? Credit ratings are important in the buying of income funds because they present a transparent outlook and help the market participants function smoothly. It is a common grading system for different levels of creditworthiness of income funds that does away with complicated jargon and makes it easier for smart investors.

While some are eyeing wealth creation, others want a passive income. If you are later, then you should select such instruments that provide regular returns on your investments. Dividend yield funds are one of them. Dividend yield fund managers typically invest in businesses that generate steady cash flows and are able to pay dividends consistently. Moreover, such businesses typically don't cut their payout during a slump. Let\u2019s have an in-depth understanding of **mutual fund dividend yield funds**. ## What are Dividend Yield Funds? In simple terms, dividend yield funds are those funds that provide returns in the form of a **mutual fund dividend** to the shareholders. Dividend yield funds are passive income-generating funds ideal for those investors who want a regular inflow of income from their investments. A dividend yield fund places its capital in equities with dividend yields that are higher than the market average. It is pertinent to note that the equities in which dividend yield funds invest (70% to 80%) are higher than the Sensex or the Nifty 50. The remaining 30-20% of stocks are invested in any profitable avenues without reservations. Compared to their growth-oriented peers, **mutual fund dividend yield funds** are typically less volatile thanks to the nature of their investments. This is because these companies are usually liquidity rich and have adequate reserves and therefore are more stable than their peers. However, experts often warn dividend yield funds to underperform in comparison to their growth fund peers in the rising market. Nevertheless, these funds suit conservative investors looking to invest in equity funds. ## How Do Dividend Yield Funds Work? Some companies declare huge dividends, while others do not declare dividends at all. Some companies distribute dividends when they make good profits and want to distribute the same to the shareholders. While other companies prefer to retain their profits for company operations and expansion. In such cases (when companies prefer to retain their profits), the share value of the company increases, leading to compounding in the future, which is ideally suited for wealth creation. Dividend yield funds, therefore, invest 70%-80% of the corpus in equity and equity instruments of companies that pay huge dividends. Such companies have good cash flows and are often considered more stable than other companies. Further, what matters here is not high **mutual fund dividends** but a high dividend yield. Let\u2019s understand with a practical example: Suppose you invest in two dividend-yielding stocks, i.e., stock A and stock B. While stock A provides a dividend of Rs. 100 per share, stock B provides a dividend of Rs. 300 per share. Stock B seems attractive, right? Why not because it gives more dividends than stock A. However, the tables turn when we come to know their share price. While the price of stock A is Rs. 500, the price of stock B is Rs. 2500. Let\u2019s calculate their dividend yield with a simple formula: _**Dividend yield = Dividend per share / current price per share * 100**_ Stock A = Rs. 100 / 500 * 100 = 20% Stock B = Rs. 300 / 2500 * 100 = 12% The dividend yield of stock A is 20%, while the dividend yield of stock B is 12%. Therefore, even though stock B is paying a higher dividend, it is still less when compared to stock A because you can just purchase five stocks of A at Rs. 2500 and earn Rs. 500 as a dividend instead of purchasing one stock of B at Rs. 2500 and earning Rs. 300 as a dividend. ## Who Should Invest in Dividend Yield Funds? Well, here comes the interesting part: who should invest in **mutual fund dividend yield funds**? If you belong to those categories of investors who want to generate a passive income, then you should go for dividend yield funds. Dividend yield funds provide investors with a regular passive income that helps them meet their costs and expenses. ## Benefits of Investing in Dividend Yield Funds Here comes the \u2018why\u2019 part, i.e., why you should invest in dividend yield funds. While it can have many reasons, you should certainly consider the following benefits of investing in dividend yield funds: \u00b7 Investors of dividend yield funds receive a regular income from their investments due to high **mutual fund dividend** payouts from the underlying equity instruments \u00b7 Companies paying huge dividends are often stable, and stocks of such companies can sail through volatility and fluctuations easily \u00b7 These funds are ideal for beginners for whom return on investment is important to stay motivated and kick-start their investment journey \u00b7 The investors of dividend-yielding funds not only get returns in the form of dividends but also receive returns in the form of capital appreciation ## Fees and Charges of Dividend Yield Funds Dividend yield funds, like any other mutual fund, also involve certain fees and charges. Dividend yield funds are actively managed funds, unlike index funds, which are passively managed. Therefore, dividend yield funds involve a higher charge as compared to their passively managed counterparts. The following are the charges you should keep in mind while investing in dividend yield funds: * **Brokerage charges:** These are the charges levied by the stockbroker. It depends upon the terms and conditions of the broker you select * **Expense ratio:** The expense ratio is the charge of maintenance and administration of funds. These charges usually vary among different funds, and the expense ratio for passively managed funds (like index funds) is lower than the actively managed funds (dividend yield funds). This is because the actively managed funds also involve higher fund manager fees for actively managing the portfolio. Always check the expense ratio before investing in any fund because it directly reduces your return on investment * **Commissions:** If you invest in dividend yield funds through a mutual fund agent or mutual fund distributor, then you ought to know about the commission charges. Mutual fund houses pay the mutual fund agents and distributors certain commissions for selling the mutual fund schemes.

As such, it can invest across large, mid, or small caps based on market capitalisation. Likewise, to explore different sectors, managers of focused funds can consider investing in chemicals, information technology, finance, pharma, healthcare, etc. Some focused equity funds are small-cap funds, sectoral funds, large-cap funds, value funds, and the like. ## **How Does a Focused Equity Fund Work?** To understand how a focused equity fund works, you should first understand the purpose of such funds. Focused funds can invest in a limited number of stocks with a maximum cap of 30 stocks. So, they have a concentrated portfolio for selecting stocks within the limit of 30 stocks. However, focused funds do not restrict where to invest, implying they can invest in any company, sector, industry, or market capitalisation. For instance, fund managers have the freedom to assess how investor money gets allocated between large caps, mid-caps, and small caps companies for maximising gains from investment. ## Who Should Invest in a Focused Equity Fund? Focused funds offer great returns over the medium to long term. However, they entail a higher risk owing to a concentrated portfolio. So, even one wrong bet on a stock could lead to huge losses for the focused equity fund scheme or vice versa. Investors must carefully evaluate their investment priorities based on the factors below before investing in a focused equity fund: ### Risk appetite A focused fund is more suitable for investors with a high-risk appetite as they are more volatile than diversified mutual funds over the short to medium term. If you are willing to take high risks to generate higher returns, then you should invest in them. ### Investing experience A focused fund has a higher risk element as it is equity-based. So, a focused equity fund may not be the right investment vehicle to start with if you are a new investor. They are more suitable for seasoned investors who understand the risks associated with focused funds and invest accordingly. ### Investment horizon As focused funds are equity funds, they need a longer period of growth traction. Also, these funds invest in select stocks, which may take time to show their true potential. So, it is more suitable for investors with a long-term investment horizon of five years and beyond. ## Taxability of Focused Equity Fund The taxability of focused equity funds is similar to other equity mutual funds. According to the Income Tax Act of 1961, short-term capital gains tax is applicable for your investment held less than one year at the rate of 15%. Investments held for more than a year attract long-term capital gains tax at 10%, provided your total gains exceed Rs.1 lakh in a fiscal year. ## Benefits of Focused Equity Funds Focused equity funds come with several benefits to investors. The following are some of them: ### Expected higher returns Focused funds invest in select high-conviction equity stocks within the permissible limit. As such, they have more scope for generating high potential returns over the medium to long term. ### Freedom to invest across diversified streams Focused funds have limits only on the number of stocks to be invested. There is no limit on where the funds can invest. As such, they have complete freedom to invest across any company irrespective of market capitalisation, industry, and sector. For instance, they can split their investment based on company size giving the fund a flexible investment option. So, fund managers can easily switch between stocks based on market conditions to maximise investor returns. Likewise, they can easily select stocks from any sector of their choice, ensuring the portfolio is not restricted to any one sector. It increases the chance of gaining higher returns over time. ### A concentrated investment in good stocks As a focused equity fund has a limit of 30 stock investments, fund managers do considerable market research to select the best stocks, which are mainly high-conviction and quality stocks. It thus ensures that the best stocks are in the investor portfolio, increasing the chances of earning higher returns than the larger stock market. ## Things to evaluate before investing in a Focused Equity Fund Following is a list of things that investors must evaluate before investing in equity funds: ### Returns In a polarised market, a focused equity fund can give better returns than diversified funds and stock markets. A polarised market is concentrated around certain stocks that drive the market while other stocks show lacklustre growth. So, if a focused fund has stocks that drive the market, you can expect exceptional returns from the scheme. In a broad-based stock market scenario, you may not earn good returns via a Focused Fund as few stocks may not drive the market. ### Risk Focused funds are more concentrated in a few stocks, with a maximum of 30 stocks in a portfolio. They take big positions in select stocks. As such, these funds are not diversified, increasing the risk in focused funds. ### Investment term Focused funds invest in select stocks. They need time to grow and could be more volatile in the short term. They are suited for investors who have a medium or long-term investment goal. ### Taxability Capital gains on redemption of a focused equity fund get the same tax treatment as that of an equity fund. So, make redemptions accordingly by considering the tax factor. ### Fund cost While investing in a focused equity fund, evaluate its expense ratio before investing. The expense ratio indicates the cost of managing your fund by the fund house. Consider focused funds with low expense ratios, as it will increase your net returns. ### Fund manager expertise Evaluate the fund manager's expertise and track record while investing in a focused equity fund to gain optimum returns from your portfolio. ## Key Takeaways Focused equity is suitable for medium to long-term investors with a high-risk appetite and who wish to gain higher returns from a concentrated portfolio of a maximum of 30 stocks. ## FAQs ### Does a focused equity fund have a lock-in period? A focused equity fund does not have a lock-in period. So, you can redeem your investments in the fund easily whenever you want within trading hours. ### Are focused equity funds risky? Focused equity funds invest a particular portion in equity stocks, so are subject to stock market risk. Also, they constitute a concentrated portfolio implying increased risk because your investments are not evenly diversified. ### What is the investment horizon of a focused fund? Focused funds should be invested from a long-term perspective of five years and beyond to earn good yields. If you are a first-time investor, you can invest in a focused equity fund, provided you are willing to stay invested for a longer period and have a higher risk appetite for maximising your returns.

Who Should Invest In It? # Thematic Funds - What Is It? Who Should Invest In It? \u00b7 6 min read ### IN THIS ARTICLE Thematic funds, as the name suggests, are mutual funds that invest in equities in a specific investment theme. The themes are mostly based on certain trends and investment stories. For example, if you are optimistic about consumption, you can go for a thematic fund on investment which will invest in FMCG and other sectors related to rising consumption by people. A thematic fund diversifies across sectors to follow its theme. If you are a person who likes to track macroeconomic trends, you will have a taste for thematic funds. Thematic funds are predominantly equity-based. The key thing to remember is that it carries the risks that are inherent in equity-linked mutual funds. ## How Do Thematic Funds Work? Thematic funds create an investment thesis around a sector. This can be in Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) factors, which means investing in firms with performance on these parameters. It can be a thematic fund that is based on real estate. It can be a theme based on steel. The money that you put into this mutual fund will be invested in equities at the portfolio manager\u2019s discretion. Money can be invested through the SIP or lumpsum model and can be withdrawn at any time. ## Who Should Invest in Thematic Funds? Professionals who have a very definite taste for investments in the high-risk equity segment can invest in thematic funds. An investor can go for an investment theme about which they are upbeat through these mutual funds. One of the reasons to invest in thematic funds is an investor gets to use the expertise of a reputed mutual fund rather than directly making investments in individual equity stocks, which can be comparatively riskier as an individual investor may not have the deep expertise or time to dedicatedly track the stocks. There are many benefits to investing through a mutual fund compared to putting all the available corpus directly in equity stocks. ## What are the Benefits of Investing in Thematic Funds? Thematic funds offer more diversification than sector-specific funds. This is because a thematic fund usually covers more than one sector. For example, a manufacturing-themed fund would invest in stocks across multiple sectors. So, if a sector is facing a downturn, the investment will shift to other industries. Possibility of high returns: Investing in an equity-linked fund brings with it the possibility of higher returns. If a theme proves to be right, and the fund manages its investments well, an investor stands a chance to make a high return on their investment. These are open-ended funds, so one can withdraw money as and when required. There is no lock-in period. ## What is the Risk Profile of Thematic Funds? Equity-related funds are always riskier than other types of funds. For instance, a well-performing fund may suddenly turn track, and stocks get beaten down very quickly. Thus, thematic funds come with these risks. The high volatility of equity-linked mutual funds makes them a high-risk, high-return investment play. ## What is the Right Investment Strategy for Getting Into Thematic Funds? Since this is a high-risk, high-return fund, an investor should set aside funds that he can afford to take a risk with. An investor should not invest funds meant for financial security and retirement in this kind of fund. An investor can look at it as a long-term equity investment and wait for returns to become substantial enough, and exit when the pricing is on the higher side. ## What are the Investment Options in Thematic Funds? There are plenty of thematic funds to choose from. You can pick a fund as per your examination of an investment story. For example, if you feel that manufacturing is going to pick up in a major way in the country, you can look at various manufacturing funds. ### The following are the most common categories of thematic funds: \u00b7 ESG fund \u00b7 Consumption fund \u00b7 Energy fund \u00b7 MNC fund \u00b7 Manufacturing fund \u00b7 PSU fund ## Fees and Charges of a Thematic Fund Thematic funds usually attract an expense ratio of 2-2.3%. This is much higher than other types of mutual funds. Many other diversified mutual funds charge an expense ratio of 1.4-1.8%. An investor should find out the expense ratio of the fund they are making an investment into, even though these are funds whose objective is to chase higher returns at the cost of higher expense and high risk. The cost is less if the mutual funds are bought through a direct fund plan. If an investor goes for a regular fund, a small commission is also paid to the advisor/intermediary. ## Taxation of Income in Thematic Funds Redeeming your funds in less than 12 months will involve paying short-term capital taxation. This means you pay 15% of the income as tax, plus surcharge and cess, irrespective of the tax slab to which you belong. If the funds are withdrawn after a year, the capital tax is reduced to 10%. There are some provisions in the income tax act which can be utilised, such as exemption of income of up to 1 lakh under long-term capital tax is waived in a financial year. This is can motivate youngsters to try out this fund. ## How Can One Make an Investment in a Thematic Mutual Fund? This can be done at the click of a few buttons. There is no need to go to any physical space. Go to Jupiter Money, and all that you need to make an investment is available, just register and swipe. ## Key Takeaway Thematic mutual funds offer a chance to make investments in equities through calculated and diversified risk. Investors who are following macroeconomic and market trends can invest in these mutual funds depending on their outlook for a particular segment. They gain by getting the expertise of mutual fund companies that actively track the market and have experience in investing, and have proven their ability to generate returns. There are times when some investment stories are doing well, such as PSU, manufacturing, MNC, energy, and consumption, and that is the time when investors look at thematic funds. One must remember, though, any fund that is dedicated to equities is subject to volatility and risk. Most investors who go for thematic funds are those who can digest the volatility and wait for a long-term horizon to get returns. ## Frequently Asked Questions ### Is a thematic fund a low-risk investment option? Not at all. For low-risk investments, one opts for mutual funds that are into debt instruments. Thematic funds invest money only in equities, and these are inherently a risky asset class. ### What is the lock-in period for investments in thematic funds? There is no lock-in period for investments in thematic funds. An investor can withdraw their funds on any business day. ### How long should one invest in thematic funds? Mutual funds dedicated to equities are based on long-term stories. In the long run, Indian companies grow, however, in the short run, they may face volatility and economic downturns. Thus, the mature investor in thematic funds gets into it for 5-7 years while keeping an eye on the investment regularly. ### How about the tax benefits of investing in a high-risk asset category? There are no taxation waivers in this category of investment. If you withdraw your money in less than a year, you are charged capital tax gains of 15%, and if you withdraw your funds are a year, this tax becomes 10%.

But one of the most prominent challenges of investment for beginners is deciding where to put their hard-earned money in. Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment products in India. Wondering what are mutual funds? This article aims to explain that in simple terms for new investors. ## What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a financial product offered by Asset Management Companies (AMCs). It is a pool of money put by multiple investors with a similar goal. Professional fund managers invest this money in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments to generate returns. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates mutual funds, but the AMCs make investment decisions. It is one of the easiest investment options in the country as experienced fund managers decide where to invest the money, freeing you of worries. ### How did mutual funds become popular? Mutual funds have gained popularity even among the most inexperienced investors as they enable earning profits from the financial market. These funds also allow you to diversify your money between different avenues to spread out the risk. Another reason mutual funds are popular is that they come in different types, offering various benefits, interest rates, and risk profiles. You may choose an option depending on your investment goal. Most AMCs also allow you to invest in mutual funds online, ensuring easy accessibility. So, their popularity among young investors is growing exponentially. ### Myths around mutual funds Most investment options have some myths surrounding them that can discourage people, and mutual funds are no different. Here are the common misconceptions about mutual funds you should know. * **Mutual funds are risky** : There are varied types of mutual funds that are fundamentally different in terms of return and risk. Not all mutual funds are equally risky. So, you may choose as per your risk appetite. * **High-rated funds offer the best returns** : Mutual fund ratings are based on their past performances. Although the rating provides you with some idea about the fund, it does not guarantee profits. So, it is advisable to diversify your mutual fund investments. * **Mutual funds are for the rich** : The is one of the biggest myths surrounding mutual funds. You may choose from different apps and websites to start investing online even with \u20b9100! ## Types of mutual funds **1\\. Debt funds** If you want a low-risk investment option, you must choose debt funds. When you invest in these, the fund managers use your money to provide loans to the government and companies. Liquid and ultra-low duration funds are two options that offer loans for a very short time. **2\\. Equity funds** The equity-based mutual funds invest in company stocks. The fund managers buy shares of well-performing companies and monitor them closely to decide when to sell or purchase further. Equity fund performance depends on the financial market\u2019s ups and downs. So, they can be risky options. But, if you invest in these funds for an extended period, it averages out the risks. **3\\. Active vs. passive funds** Active equity funds are the ones that have dedicated fund managers deciding which stocks to buy or sell. You need to pay a fund management fee for the service. On the other hand, passive equity funds do not have any fund managers. They automatically buy stocks of companies listed under the Nifty50 and Sensex indexes. You do not have to pay any additional fee to invest in passive funds. **4\\. Large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap funds** Large-cap funds invest money only in big, well-established companies. These funds entail low risk and offer stable returns. Mid-cap funds buy stocks of medium-sized companies that have brand recognition but still are not as big as blue-chip firms. Investing in these funds can be relatively risky, but the return is high. On the other hand, a small-cap fund invests in new, small companies. They have the potential to generate high profits, but the risk quotient is much higher than large-cap funds/mid-cap funds. **5\\. Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)** ELSS is a tax-saving mutual fund that diversifies your investment into stocks of large, medium, and small companies. Your investment in ELSS stays locked for three years, and withdrawing the funds before that requires you to pay an exit load. One of the benefits of investing in ELSS mutual funds is that they offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ## Importance of fund managers in mutual funds Fund managers handle your money and invest it in suitable financial instruments on your behalf. They are experienced professionals who ensure the maximum possible returns while managing risks. Fund managers have in-depth knowledge of the financial market that helps them decide which stocks to invest in, and when to buy or sell them. ### What is a mutual fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) When you put money in mutual funds, the AMCs assign a fixed number of shares or units to you. The number of units you have depends on your invested amount. The mutual fund NAV is the value of each of these units. If you know the NAV, you can easily track the fund\u2019s performance. ### Long-term and short-term capital gains taxes on mutual funds Your investments in equity mutual funds attract capital gains tax based on specific regulations. If you stay invested in the fund for up to one year, the profit is considered a short-term capital gain. You need to pay a 15% short-term capital gains tax on the income. Moreover, the amount does not depend on your income tax bracket. When you hold your investment in an equity mutual fund for over a year, you make long-term capital gains from it. If the profit is over \u20b91 lakh, you need to pay a 10% long-term capital gains tax on the exceeding amount. ## Why are mutual funds good for you? If you are a beginner, mutual funds can serve as a starting point for your investments. As experienced fund managers handle these funds, you do not have to worry about keeping up with the market trends. Instead, the fund managers do it on your behalf and try to offer the best returns. There are a variety of mutual funds with different risk proportions. If you are not sure which one is right for your portfolio, consider using the \u201c100 minus age\u201d formula. For example, if you are 30 years old, your investment in risky equity mutual funds should be 70% (100-30). You must put the remaining amount in debt-based funds. Similarly, if your age is 50 years, your investment in equity-based funds should not be more than 50% (100-50). In simple words, you need to lower your risk appetite as you grow older. ### How to Tracking your mutual fund\u2019s performance is easy if you know its NAV. When the NAV changes, the fund\u2019s performance changes with it. If you have 100 units with a NAV of \u20b910, the total fund value is \u20b91000. If the NAV becomes \u20b920, the total fund value will be \u20b92000, reflecting a profit of \u20b91000. Before investing in a mutual fund, it is important to choose the right one as per your investment goals. You may determine which mutual funds are best suited for you based on your expected returns, budget, investment tenure, and risk appetite.

Now, it is time to start thinking of investing all the extra cash. And while you mull over your options, include this important aspect of investing while conducting your research\u2014Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). ## What is CAGR? CAGR is the average annual growth rate of an investment over a certain period, typically longer than a year, assuming compound growth. You can also think of it as the rate of return that is needed for an investment to grow in value, from start to finish, all while reinvesting the profits at the end of every period of the investment\u2019s tenure. How Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) works Calculating the arithmetic average or mean of returns has its share of limitations. CAGR helps overcome these because it provides a smoothed rate of return. It gives you a decent projection of the yields from an investment annually when compounded and can be used to assess the performance of different investments over time. Most of us are only concerned with the absolute return of our investments when we look at their performance. However, the time value of money is often ignored by us. This is how CAGR is different. In fact, the CAGR formula takes the time value of money into consideration. ## What is the CAGR formula? The Compound Annual Growth Rate formula is: CAGR = x 100 Where n is the investment period Now, let us look at how it is calculated. ## How is CAGR calculated? From the CAGR calculation formula above, we understand that it is calculated by following these four steps. 1. First, divide the investment value at the end of the investment period by the value of the same investment at the beginning of the period. 2. Next, raise the subsequent result to the power of one by the number of years. 3. Subtract one from this result. 4. Finally, to convert the result to a percentage, multiply it by 100. With this, you have an idea as to how to calculate the CAGR for your investments. But how can you use it in your daily life? Read on. ## How is CAGR useful? If you have been investing for a while, you know that your rate of return is never constant. It keeps varying from one year to another. However, the CAGR helps smoothen these variations out. So, if you want to calculate how much all your investments will return over a period of years, the CAGR will assume a constant growth rate across these five years. So, now it becomes easier for you to compare or track investment growth and performance, provided you reinvest your profits every year. How do investors use CAGR? Investors can use it in the following ways. Let us look at each with an example. ### Compare investments Let us say that in 2015, an investor put INR 10,000 in his bank account at a 1% rate of interest and another INR 10,000 in mutual funds. Making a direct comparison between the two might be difficult considering the fluctuating rates of return from the stock market. So, the investor can make use of CAGR to understand the difference in return between the two investments. Let us assume that the investor has INR 10,150.10 in his bank account and INR 15,348.52 in his mutual fund after five years. Now, if you apply the CAGR formula, you will find that the bank account, as promised, provided a return of 1% and the stock market gave a return of 8.95%. Naturally, you might be mistaken that the mutual fund option is more lucrative; however, the CAGR does not factor in the volatility of the stock market. ### Find the present or future value of money The CAGR formula can be used to arrive at the initial value of an investment for it to be worth something in the future. For instance, let us say an investor needs INR 50,000 and expects a rate of return of 8%, he could find out how much he requires to save today, depending on the tenure he prefers. ### Identifying the right avenue for investment Using the example above, let us assume that the investor knows he needs INR 50,000 at the end of 18 years and has INR 10,000 ready for investing today. Using the CAGR calculation formula, the investor will know that the rate of return for INR 10,000 to become INR 50,000 in 18 years should be 6.90%. So, now he will look for an avenue that will give him a similar rate of return. ## Advantages of CAGR It is an effective tool that helps determine the profitability of investments over a certain period. Short-term CAGR takes in all factors that affect the performance of your investments, and these include market parameters too. In the long-term, it excludes all short-term fluctuations considering the possibility of your investment recovering from market variations. As a result, it is used by several investors to understand the true potential or the strengths and weaknesses of companies. ## Disadvantages of CAGR Like we discussed already, CAGR is not the most effective measure to determine an investment\u2019s performance. It is only a representation. Moreover, it does not account for the fluctuations in the stock market that have a direct impact on the performance of companies. As a result of the first limitation, CAGR cannot be used to assess risk accurately. You, as an investor, might not be able to understand the performance of a security just based on the CAGR of a company because short-term variations are not factored in. So, along with CAGR, you would need to use other analytical tools to arrive at an investment decision. ## Example of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) We already know that the CAGR formula is (End value/ Beginning value) ^1/n -1 x 100 Let us understand this with an example. Suppose you invested INR 2,000 in Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) for three years. The initial Net Asset Value (NAV) of your investment was INR 2,000, then it increased to INR 2,200 in the next year, and finally stood at INR 2,400 at the end of three years. So, the CAGR would be: CAGR = (2400/2000) ^\u2153 - 1 x 100 = 6.27% ## The difference between absolute return and CAGR in mutual funds By now, you would have understood what CAGR is and how it can be useful to investors. So, do you need to use the CAGR when evaluating an investment? Well, investors use both absolute returns and the CAGR to determine the returns on investment. But there are differences between the two. When you calculate the return as a function of the initial value and the final value and do not consider the tenure of the investment, you will arrive at the absolute returns on mutual funds. The formula for absolute return is similar to the CAGR formula but it does not include the time. x 100 So, if you invest INR 2,00,000 in mutual funds and sometime in the future this amount stands at INR 6,00,000, the absolute return would be: x 100 = 200% The absolute return is 200% but you do not know how long it could take to arrive at this return. It could be months or years. So, you can never determine the viability of an asset by simply calculating the absolute return. Moreover, it cannot be used to compare two investments. On the other hand, the CAGR can indicate the growth of an investment over a period. It smoothens out the volatility of a fund and can be followed easily. It can be used to compare two investments as well. In the previous example, we saw that the absolute return was 200%. If we were to assume that the investment matured to INR 6,00,000 in three years, we could calculate the CAGR return as x 100 = 44.22% So, you can see that the investment grew by 44.22% every year to grow into INR 6,00,000. This was the average growth each year. On the other hand, the absolute return on this investment was 200%. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to CAGR ### How to calculate the CAGR in mutual funds? Calculating CAGR in mutual funds is simple. You may calculate how a mutual fund has performed over a period by using the CAGR formula. Let\u2019s say an investment of INR 1,50,000 grew to INR 3,25,000 in three years. The CAGR of this mutual fund would be x 100 = 29.40%. ### Is CAGR used in banking too? Usually, in banking, it is the annual yield from your investment that is considered and not the CAGR. Yield is the amount of interest you can earn in a year on your investment. ### Is the IRR better or CAGR? When you are making a one-time investment, these are the same. However, the internal rate of return (IRR) is a better tool to calculate varying returns from different investments.

He who understands it, earns it, he who doesn't, pays it.\u2019 So, the compounding effect on a regular investment of a small amount over the long term can help you to accumulate a large corpus. Often, many individuals ignore the compounding effect on their investments, which can be one of the most important accelerators in growing their wealth and accumulating a huge corpus. And knowing how it works can help you to not only earn higher returns but also plan your life goals. ## What is the power of compounding? The power of compounding can be compared to the snowball effect where you can see a small ball of snow growing larger as it rolls down the slope. In the same way, compounding helps in increasing your savings by accumulating more returns on the interest earned on the initial principal investment. Compounding essentially earns \u2018interest on interest\u2019, which means you will not only earn the interest on your initial investment but also earn additional interest on these earnings. Eventually, compounding interest helps in building wealth over the years. ## How does the power of compounding work in investments? The most exciting effect of compound interest is that your investments accrue returns both on the principal amount as well as the previously earned interest. This means, compounding provides a broader base, which is added to the previous earnings at every investment cycle. Therefore, it is important you reinvest your earnings to build wealth. You must ensure you do not withdraw your earnings before the end of the investment period. It is recommended you choose the product and the horizon based on your financial goals and investible surplus. Here is an example to understand the power of compound interest. Let us assume you have invested INR 5 lakhs for a period of five years at an annual interest rate of 10%. **_Year_** | **_Opening balance (INR)_** | **_Interest (10% per annum)_** | **_Closing balance (INR)_** ---|---|---|--- 1 | 5,00,000 | 50,000 | 5,50,000 2 | 5,50,000 | 55,000 | 6,05,000 3 | 6,05,000 | 60,500 | 6,65,500 4 | 6,65,500 | 66,550 | 7,32,050 5 | 7,32,050 | 73,205 | 8,05,255 Thus, the value of your initial INR 5 lakhs at the end of five years is over INR 8 lakhs and the difference is the total capital gains earned as interest. ## How to gain the maximum compounding benefits? Here are three ways to maximize your gains from compound interest. ### Begin early When you start your investments early, you can stay invested for a longer period. The longer you stay invested, the more time will your money have to multiply, thereby helping in accumulating a significant corpus over the years. Additionally, the longer your investment horizon, the lesser will be the amount you need to save to build a huge fund. ### Make wise investment decisions Multiple financial instruments are available. It is recommended you conduct extensive research on the different products and invest in high-return products while considering your risk appetite. Your investment decisions should help deliver an attractive real rate of return to ensure you meet your financial goals and create wealth over the years. ### Grow your investments and be disciplined Most people know that they can build more wealth when they invest a higher amount; however, this is a commonly overlooked aspect. You should ensure you save more as and when your income increases. Additionally, invest regularly and follow discipline to create wealth. Opt for systematic investment plans (SIPs) that ensure a particular amount is invested in your chosen product at periodic intervals. ## How to calculate compounding benefits of any investments There are several investment options that offer compound interest on the principal amount. Generally, these financial products have a predetermined compounding period, such as annually, quarterly, monthly, and in some cases even daily. The formula to calculate compound interest is A = P x (1 + r/n) ^ (n x t) Where: A is the maturity amount, P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate per annum, N is the number of times interest is compounded, T is the investment period. Here is an example to understand what the power of compounding is. Assume that you invest INR 1 lakh at an annual interest rate of 10% for five years and the interest is compounded quarterly. Using the above formula, the maturity amount is as follows: A = 1,00,000 x (1+0.10/12) ^ (12 x 5) = INR 164530 Now, if you had invested INR 1 lakh in an instrument that offered 10% simple interest for five years, the accumulated amount at the end of the investment period would be only INR 1.50 lakhs. Therefore, compound interest investments help you build more wealth over the long term. Further, manual calculations may be tedious; so, you may use online calculators to estimate the power of compounding in a jiffy. ## Power of compounding in mutual funds As discussed, compounding can help in wealth creation when you invest a certain amount at regular intervals. But you may be wondering where to invest this money. The answer is in mutual funds via SIPs. You may invest a fixed amount at a certain interval, such as monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually in your chosen mutual funds with compound interest option. Based on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment horizon, you may consider investing in equity schemes to meet retirement needs as such funds can potentially deliver higher returns over the long term. Your SIP investments can grow exponentially over the years. You may use an online mutual fund compound interest calculator to determine how much your money can grow over your desired investment horizon. If you invest INR 10,000 per month for a period of 30 years at an expected return on investment of 15% per year, the total investment will be INR 36 lakhs. The total estimated returns will be approximately INR 6.65 crores, which shows the potential effect of mutual fund compounding. ## How to increase your savings by using the power of compounding? To increase your savings, it is advisable to opt for shorter compounding intervals. A shorter interval increases the impact of compounding, thereby allowing you to build a sizeable corpus. Direct equities or equity mutual funds can deliver higher returns but these products are subject to market volatility. If you are a risk-averse investor, consider putting money in fixed-income securities like debt funds, National Pension System (NPS), fixed deposits, and others. ## Basic rules of investing everyone should be aware of One of the basic rules of investing is to increase the investment amount to earn higher returns. If you have a limited income, you should look for ways to increase the investible surplus by reducing your expenses. Determine a budget and identify ways in which you can reduce the expenditure. Another rule is to be patient and not look for quick ways to make high returns. Chasing quick returns can lead to expensive mistakes. Compounding works best when you stay invested for the long term and let your money work for you to build a sizeable corpus over the years. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### What is the power of compounding? With compounding, your returns on the initial investment are reinvested to earn additional income. As a result, you can build wealth over the years. ### How can you maximize the benefits of compounding? To maximize the benefits of compounding, it is recommended to start early, adopt a disciplined approach to saving and investing, and be patient to give your investments sufficient time to build a large corpus. ### Is daily or monthly compounding more beneficial? Monthly compounding means that the interest is calculated and reinvested every month whereas in daily compounding, it is calculated and reinvested every day. The basic principle of compounding suggests that the shorter the frequency of compounding, the higher will be the returns. Therefore, daily compounding is more beneficial than monthly compounding.

Overview, Types, Formula, and Importance # What is Liquidity Ratio? Overview, Types, Formula, and Importance \u00b7 7 min read ### IN THIS ARTICLE Wondering what is liquidity ratio? Simply put, it is a metric that helps understand a company\u2019s ability to pay off short-term debt. It is helpful to estimate whether a company\u2019s current assets can cover its liabilities. It is largely used by banks and other financial institutions to determine whether they can extend credit to a business. ## Importance of liquidity ratio A liquidity ratio can guide businesses on their ability to repay debt and help them plan better. In addition, it plays a significant role in other situations. ### It helps determine whether short-term obligations can be met Investors and creditors alike are likely to have a keen eye for the liquidity ratio of a business because it helps them ascertain whether an extension of credit is viable. A ratio of one is good but it isn\u2019t always ideal. A higher ratio, perhaps of two or three, is what banks prefer to see because that means that a business can cover its liabilities sufficiently well. ### It helps estimate the creditworthiness of a company When lending to a company, creditors look at its liquidity ratio as a symbol of its creditworthiness. It is imperative that the company can back the debt it borrows, and the liquidity ratio is a good yardstick to learn that. ### It helps understand whether funds can be invested in a company A company with a good liquidity ratio of more than one is considered healthy and investment worthy. However, a high liquidity ratio, say 9%, is a problem because that means the company holds too much idle cash, which can be put to use elsewhere. At the end of the day, a company should be able to cover for liabilities and other bills, and at the same time, allocate its capital in a manner that can increase its value to its shareholders. ### It helps identify a company\u2019s operational efficiency If you are to understand the inventory turnover of a company, this ratio can serve as a good benchmark. It helps to gauge how well a company sells off its inventory for cash and helps companies plan their production of goods, storage of inventory, and preparation for any overhead expenses. ### It helps optimize management The management of a company plays a significant role in its financial health. So, a financial metric like a liquidity ratio can help companies enhance management efficiency to keep up with creditors. ## Types of liquidity ratios As you already know, a liquidity ratio of more than one translates into good financial health. Let\u2019s look at the different types of liquidity ratios. There is a liquidity ratio formula for each of these. ### Quick Ratio The quick ratio is also referred to as the acid-test ratio and is arguably the best way to measure the liquidity of a company. The explanation behind this lies in the formula used to calculate the quick ratio. Only short-term assets that can be easily converted into cash in less than 90 days or are already being held as cash are considered when calculating the quick ratio. A ratio of 1:1 (assets to liabilities) is generally held to be an ideal quick ratio. Quick Ratio Formula: Quick Ratio = Quick Assets/Current liability where, Quick Assets = Current Assets \u2013 Inventory \u2013 Prepaid Expenses or, Quick Ratio = (Marketable Securities + Available Cash and/or Equivalent of Cash + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities Example **Particulars** | **Amount (Crores)** ---|--- Market securities | 12,000 Cash and equivalent | 68,000 Accounts receivable | 7,500 Inventory | 20,000 Current assets | 1,07,500 Current liabilities | 55,000 Quick ratio | (12,000+68,000+7,500)/55,000 = 1.6 or (1,07,500-20,000)/55,000 = 1.6 ### Current Ratio The current ratio is also known as the working capital ratio. It measures your current assets like cash, receivables, prepaid expenditures, and others against your current liabilities like short-term loans, to determine whether the company can pay them off. Current Ratio Formula: Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities Example Current assets = 420 crores Current liabilities = 210 crores Current ratio = 420 crores/210 crores = 2 A ratio of 2:1 is considered healthy for a company. ### Cash Ratio The cash ratio tells you how well a company can pay off its current liabilities using cash and other equivalent instruments (treasury bills, marketable instruments, and others). Other assets that are not held as cash must not be included to calculate this ratio. Cash Ratio Formula: Cash ratio = Cash and cash equivalents/Current liabilities Example Cash and cash equivalent = 900 crore Current liabilities = 470 crore Cash ratio = 900 crore/470 crore = 1.91 ### Absolute Liquidity Ratio Creditors use this ratio to understand the total liquidity of the company. For the purposes of this ratio, only cash, and marketable securities of the company can be included. Absolute Liquidity Ratio Formula: Absolute liquidity ratio = (Cash + marketable securities)/ Current liabilities Example Cash = 600 crores Marketable securities = 1500 crores Current liabilities = 2000 crores Absolute liquidity ratio = 600 crores + 1500 crores/2000 crores = 1.05 ### Basic Defence Ratio Through this ratio, a lender can determine how far a company can handle its cash expenses with no financial help from outside. It is also known by the name defensive interval period. Basic Defence Ratio Formula: Basic defence ratio = Cash and equivalent + marketable securities + receivable/ daily operational expenses Daily operational expenses = (annual operational costs \u2013 noncash expenses)/365 Example **_Particulars_** | **_Amount (in crores)_** ---|--- Cash and equivalent | 1,15,000 Marketable securities | 45,000 Accounts receivable | 70,000 Current liquid assets | 2,30,000 **_Daily operational expenses_** | **_Amount _** Annual operating costs | 6,00,000 Non-cash expenses | 80,000 Daily operational expenses | 6,00,000-80,000/365 = 1,424 Basic defence ratio | 2,30,000/1,424 = 161 ### Basic Liquidity Ratio Unlike the other liquidity ratio, the basic liquidity ratio does not pertain to a company. Instead, it is a personal finance ratio that determines the length of time that a family individual can take care of itself with its liquid assets. Basic Liquidity Ratio Formula: Basic liquidity ratio= Monetary assets/Monthly expenses Example Monetary assets = 500000 Monthly expenses = 250000 Basic liquidity ratio = 500000/250000 = 2 Apart from these, there is the liquidity coverage ratio that reflects the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions like banks and others hold to ensure their capability to meet short-run obligations. ## Understanding a good liquidity ratio Understanding the different formulas and liquidity ratio examples can have several benefits. It will not only help you identify your company\u2019s current financial health but also serve as a good measure of what is to be done to offset a deficit if any. As we discussed earlier, a good liquidity ratio is anything that goes north of one. However, in most cases, it is insufficient to prove the creditworthiness and the investment worthiness of your business. Several creditors and investors look for an accounting liquidity ratio that hovers around two or three. Naturally, a higher liquidity ratio spells a healthier margin of safety as far as your ability to pay off debts and other obligations is concerned. However, it isn\u2019t always a good thing. For instance, if your liquidity ratio is too high then investors might wonder what you\u2019re doing with excess cash. It questions the company\u2019s intentions to grow and its focus on profits. Instead of holding too much cash in hand, it is more profitable to allocate your capital to other initiatives and investments. The complete picture may not be presented if you were to look at just the liquidity ratio separately. It needs to be combined with other financial metrics and compared with ratios over a period to understand the trend that your company has been following in terms of financial health. If your liquidity ratios are volatile, then your company may be looked at as operationally risky and financially unstable. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### Are solvency and liquidity the same? If not, how are they different? No, they are not the same. Liquidity is a measure that assesses the company\u2019s assets to cover its short-term debt. On the other hand, solvency is the ability of a company to pay off its total debt while continuing to be in business. To understand the solvency of a company, its liquidity needs to be considered. ### What is the ideal current ratio? An ideal current ratio is anything more than one. A higher current ratio is an indicator of a good financial position. However, please note that a high accounting liquidity ratio is not necessarily a good thing. ### What is meant by SLR? According to certain guidelines set by the RBI, a business (a commercial bank) must hold a minimum percentage of certain assets such as government securities, cash, gold, and others. This percentage is referred to as the Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR. ### What is the most liquid asset? The most liquid asset in the world is cash. If a business or a company holds a good reserve of cash, liquidity ratios are consequently higher. In other words, the business is in a good position to pay short-term financial debt with no support from the outside. However, a very high reserve of cash means that the business has poorly allocated capital and that might raise concerns in a few creditors.

When you repay the borrowed money, you pay an extra amount to the lender. The extra amount is the Interest, and the borrowed money is the principal amount. **Compound Interest** Compound Interest is when you experience a steady increase in your wealth as you earn Interest on the total investments, the aggregate principal amount, and the incurred Interest. In simple words, it is the Interest you earn on Interest. The concepts are, however, easy to understand yet are a bit tricky in a practical sense. So, to lessen your burden and give instant results, we have the Simple and Compound Interest calculators. # All about Jupiter's Interest Calculators Simple Interest Calculator The Simple Interest Calculator is a tool that helps you compute the maturity value of your assets without compounding.

Suppose you invested Rs 20,000 at a 5% interest rate for 2 years. The Simple Interest Calculator will show the total Interest as Rs 2000 and the Maturity value as Rs 22,000. ## Compound Interest Calculator The Compound Interest Calculator computes the estimated returns with interest compounding. It asks for the compounding frequency and other essential information and swiftly calculates the Interest. ### **Working of Compound Interest Calculator** The Compound Interest Calculator uses the following formula to calculate the earnings: **A=P(1+r/n)^nt** For example - If you invest/borrow Rs 20,000 at a 10% interest rate for 5 years at a yearly compounding frequency.

There are multiple ways you can compare different investment options to determine which offers the highest returns. One popular method is the Return on Investment (ROI). You can use an ROI calculator to compare different investment products quickly. ## **What is Return on Investment (ROI)?** ROI shows the ratio between total profits made from an investment and the total investment cost. Simply put, you can use the ROI method to compare the invested amount and the income earned. It also helps understand the profitability of an investment option and decide if it is a good choice for you. Another important aspect of ROI is that you get the answer in percentage form. So, if the calculation shows the result is 0.20, it means the ROI is 20%. ROI is a commonly used method to calculate investment profitability because it is quick and simple. Moreover, the data required for ROI is easy to determine; you know how much money you will invest, and most investment products show the potential returns. Additionally, ROI shows the result in percentage form, which is easy to understand. It makes comparing different investment options a simple task, allowing you to choose the best financial instrument. One essential thing to know about ROI is that it refers to different types of measurements, which include Average Rate of Return (ARR), Earnings per Share (EPS), and the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). But investors use it more frequently to measure the simple return on investment. You can estimate ROI in seconds by using an ROI calculator online. ## About ROI calculator The calculator allows you to compute ROI effortlessly. It has sections where you need to provide the investment amount and expected returns. You must also mention the investment period for the tool to work. Once you input the details, the calculator will show you the Gain on Investment, Return on Investment, Absolute ROI, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). ### The formula to measure ROI The calculator makes it simple for you to determine the ROI, but it is always wise to learn how the ROI formula works. It plays a crucial role in investments and can make all the difference between choosing the right investment product and suffering loss. To use the formula, you need Gain from Investment (G) and Cost of Investment (C). Based on the above information, the formula is ROI = . You can multiply the result by 100 to determine ROI percentage. One disadvantage of the formula is that it only considers the numerical values provided but cannot calculate the associated risk with any investment instrument. ## How does the ROI calculator work? Now that you know how to calculate ROI using the formula, it is time to understand how the calculator works with the equation. When you input investment amount, expected returns, and investment period, the calculator uses the above formula to determine Absolute Return. It then shows the value in percentage form. As you can see, calculating the Absolute Return does not require using the investment period. But the calculator needs the information to determine Annualized Return on Investment, which is the investment product\u2019s performance over different periods. The formula for Annualized ROI is more extensive compared to Absolute Return. Let us understand both aspects of using ROI with different examples. ### Example of ROI calculation Suppose you bought a property worth \u20b960 lakhs, and you sell it for \u20b990 lakhs after 5 years. the formula, , we get the Absolute Return: (\u20b990 lakhs \u2013 \u20b960 lakhs) / \u20b960 lakhs = 0.50. So, the return on the investment in your property is 50%. **Annualized Return on Investment (ROI) formula and example** The basic ROI calculation formula does not include the period during which you held the investment, which is the holding period. If you want to take the holding period into account, Annualized ROI can help. The formula for Annualized ROI: x 100% In the formula, \u2018n\u2019 is the holding period in terms of the number of years. Let us apply the same example as above to understand how the calculation for Annualized ROI works. * **Investment** : \u20b960 lakhs * **Total return** : \u20b990 lakhs * **ROI** : 0.50 * **Holding period** : 5 years So, the Annualized ROI is x 100% = 8.45%. If the holding period is less than a year, you can still use the formula by converting \u2018n\u2019 into a fraction of a year. Check the below Annualized ROI calculation example: * **ROI** : 0.10 * **Holding period** : 6 months = 0.5 years * So, the Annualized ROI will be: x 100% = 21% ## Benefits of ROI ROI calculation offers many benefits. Below is a list of the six most significant ones. **1\\. Easy profitability measurement** ROI provides you with a clear idea about the profitability of an investment option. This allows you to compare different products to determine which one can generate the most profit quickly. So, you can use your available assets better and get the best out of your investment. You may also compare the cost with the profit of each investment product to determine their rate of return. **2\\. Increasing overall profit** If you maintain a diversified investment portfolio, you can measure the overall ROI of the portfolio and the ROI of every individual investment plan. This makes it easy to measure the profitability of every financial product under the portfolio and determine where you can make improvements. When the ROI of one instrument improves, the overall ROI increases. **3\\. Quick comparative analysis** If you want to invest in stocks, it is important to compare different companies in their asset utilization and productivity before deciding where to put your hard-earned money. ROI becomes even more essential when comparing businesses of similar size, belonging to the same industry. You may use the ROI calculation to analyze the different companies\u2019 profitability closely, allowing you to make an informed choice. **4\\. Performance measurement** A key factor of maintaining a profitable investment portfolio is keeping a close eye on every asset. ROI helps you determine which options are performing well and which are not. Based on that, you can buy and sell products from your portfolio to ensure maximum profits. If you want to invest your money in a fund, ROI will also help compare the performance of different funds. You may then choose the one that has been performing well over the years. **5\\. Choosing an investment company** If you are considering using the services of an investment company, there are multiple things you have to first check. The company must be excellent at asset utilization, cost management, pricing strategy, and marketing apart from investment planning. A company with a high ROI percentage shows the signs of being good at what they do. **6\\. Simplicity of use** The data required to calculate ROI is readily available. You only need to know the investment cost and probable returns to calculate ROI. So, it is a simple procedure that almost anyone can use to make the right investment decisions. ## Drawbacks of ROI ROI has a few limitations, too. Three of its drawbacks are as follows: **1\\. Definition of profit differs** The word \u2018profit\u2019 may have different definitions. The amount of profit from an investment product depends on multiple factors such as taxes and interests. Some instruments might even have associated costs that are deducted from the return, lowering your profits. As ROI does not take all these into account, the result might not always be accurate. **2\\. Difficult to compare different companies** Development expenditure, fixed asset valuations, stock price assessment, and many other financial aspects vary between companies. So, a simple comparison of different companies based on ROI might not always offer a clear picture. **3\\. Does not account for risk** ROI only accounts for Gain from Investment and Cost of Investment. It ignores multiple other factors associated with an investment, such as risk. An investment product with a high rate of return can be risky as well. As ROI does not consider that, the result might not always be precise. ## FAQs **1\\. Why does the ROI calculator show both Absolute Return and Annualized ROI?** Absolute Return only shows your profit percentage from any investment held for one year or less. To compare returns during an extended holding period, you need to use the Annualized ROI calculation. **2\\. How can the ROI calculator help?** The calculator makes it easy to compare different investment products. It gives you an idea about which investment avenue has a better chance of providing higher returns. **3\\. Is it difficult to use the ROI calculator?** No, the calculator is quite easy to use. You only need to input the investment amount, expected returns, and investment period on the tool. It will do the rest and show you the result within seconds. Many investors use the ROI calculator in India. It can be a great tool if you know how to use it properly.

Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is the essential reserves requirement expected from banks before giving customers credits. It is a minimum percentage that commercial banks have to adhere to in terms of cash, gold, or security. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not keep these reserves, but they ask the bank to maintain them. The RBI fixes the SLR. It is a form to control credit growth in India. A Statutory Liquidity Ratio is mandatory for commercial banks. It plays a significant role in deciding the minimum lending rate of banks at which the latter can offer credit to their customers. SLR rate helps build transparency between the banks and the RBI. ## How does SLR work? Knowing what SLR is crucial to understanding how it works. Let us take a look at its functionality. Banks must keep a portion of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL), ie, liquid assets, cash and gold. The ratio of these liquid assets to the demand and time liabilities is the statutory liquidity ratio. This percentage is kept aside for central or state government-approved securities which invest in liquid assets. The RBI has the right to increase this ratio by 40%. SLB is one of its few financial approaches for something similar. SLR (among different apparatuses) is instrumental in getting the dissolvability of the banks and income in the economy. Additionally, a lift in the proportion tightens the capacity of the bank to boost cash into the economy. RBI is additionally obligated for managing the progression of money and the soundness of costs to run the Indian economy. ## **Importance of statutory liquidity ratio** The SLR is a money-related approach method of the RBI; the public authority should make its obligation to the executive's programme compelling. SLR has assisted the public authorities with offering its protections or obligation approach to banks. The public authority utilises the SLR for direct expansion and liquidity. Expanding the SLR will control growth in the economy while diminishing it will cause development. The majority of the banks will keep their SLR as government protection to procure them a premium pay. The most elevated restriction of SLR in India was 40%. Then again, the base furthest reaches of SLR is 0. As of 10th April 2022, the RBI-approved SLR rate in India is 18%. When there is an ascent in the SLR, a bank is likewise confined as far as its influence position. If any bank has not been effective in keeping up with the predetermined SLR (as recommended by the RBI), the bank will be expected to suffer specific consequences. All banks should obligatorily give a report or an update to the Reserve Bank of India each substitute Friday regarding their SLR status. Thus, this ascent in the SLR will empower a bank to deliver more assets to the economy and contribute to general economic improvement. ## **What are the SLR\u2019s objectives?** The main objective of the SLR rate is to stabilise liquidity in banking institutions presently operating in India. * Monitor inflation and credit flow. * To help the RBI to guarantee the well-being of a business bank. * Support the government's debt management programme. * Avoid asset liquidation when the cash reserve ratio (CRR) is increased. * To control the extension of bank credits. The RBI can increment or reduce bank credit development by changing the SLR rates. * Through SLR, the central bank powers the business banks to put resources into government protections. ## **What are the different SLR components?** The two main SLR components are as follows: ### **Net demand and time liabilities** This is the complete mutual peace between demands and time deposits of the public that a bank holds. Liabilities that a bank should pay on request, containing current and investment accounts and request drafts, are demand deposits. Demand deposits are considered as all liabilities that the bank should pay. Late fixed deposits, demand drafts, current deposits and demand liabilities are some examples that are considered part of investment savings bank deposits. ### **Liquid assets** The assets that get converted into cash easily in one or two days are known as liquid assets. These include government bonds, marketable securities, treasury bills, gold and other cash equivalents. They even consider eligible securities procured through specific, RBI approved securities in a few cases. ## **How to calculate SLR?** The percentage of total demand and time liabilities of the bank is called SLR. Deposits of customers paid to them on demand at any time are called demand liabilities. There is a period mutually agreed upon after which commercial banks are liable to pay customers; that amount is called time liabilities. * **Time liability example:** Nine-month fixed deposit, which is payable only after nine months and not on demand. * **Demand deposit:** A deposit in a current or savings account that is payable to the customer through demand or cheque. The formula for calculating SLR is: **SLR = % of net demand & time liabilities (NDTL)** ## **Why is the statutory liquidity ratio fixed?** SLR is fixed to keep a tap on the expansion of the bank's credit. It ensures that bank invests in government securities like bonds, and it makes sure that commercial banks get into solvency. The RBI is liable to pay a penalty of 3% above the bank rate on the low amount for that particular day if they fail to maintain the prescribed SLR. The RBI is the one that decides the percentage of SLR, and it only increases and decreases its rate. At the time of inflation, it expands, and it expands at the time of recession. ## **What is the difference between the CRR and the SLR?** RBI monetary policy consists of two components: CRR and SLR. SLR is the statutory liquid ratio, and CRR is the cash reserve ratio. SLR is the percentage ratio of the deposits such as gold, security bonds, PSU bonds, and many more in liquid assets. As of April 2022, the rates of both are as given below: CRR=4% SLR=18% The primary differences between CRR and SLR are: * SLR includes liquid assets such as gold, securities, and bonds, and CRR has cash reserves only. * Bank keeps SLR funds with itself. However, CRR funds are with RBI. * Banks earn interest on SLR. However, there is no interest in CRR. * CRR controls liquidity, and SLR controls credit expansion. ## **Current statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) rate** The current SLR rate is 18%. The RBI reserves all rights to increase or decrease the present SLR rate. ## **Impact of SLR on the investors** In India, the base rate alludes to the RBI-fixed base rate. The base rate, likewise, helps verify that banks offer low costs of funds to any of their clients, and it helps limit advance costs for all borrowers. This is the rate under which no bank can loan funds to borrowers, and this is not entirely settled to ensure transparency when banks lend funds to people in the credit market. The statutory liquidity ratio assumes an exceptionally prominent part in fixing the base rate of the Indian economy. The RBI additionally investigates how banks screen their accessibility of funds for tolerating deposits from customers and forgiving them as credits to customers. The statutory liquidity ratio is routinely observed so that banks have a more substantial influence and a superior affecting viewpoint. Hence, the SLR plays a part in deciding the country's base rate. The public authorities and the RBI cooperate to adjust the SLR. The base rate is not entirely analysed by the statutory liquidity ratio, cash reserve ratio, cost of borrowings, upward expenses, overhead deposits, etc. Consequently, it is concocting an ever-increasing number of procedures and methods that can be applied practically to ensure that banks have adequate funds in their safe for prepared credit. Before this, banks used to try not to have any passive funds in their branches and subsequently, when there was an abrupt and pressing necessity for credit or some other type of funds, they fizzled as a moneylender. However, the RBI makes it compulsory for banks to keep a specific funds ratio with the country's central bank. The RBI additionally believes banks should be highly cautious with the advances given by the public authorities. The SLR ratio is viewed as one of the reference rates when RBI decides the base rate. The base rate is the base loaning rate, and no bank can loan beneath this base rate. Similarly, this rate is fixed to guarantee transparency in borrowing and lending in the credit market. ## **Reduction in the SLR** At times, the RBI reduces the SLR of the banks in the country. There are several reasons for the reduction in SLR: * The RBI cuts the SLR rate to improve the overall economy financially and economically. All the banks in the country try to attain the accurate SLR rate set by the RBI by following and working towards specific goals by planning, designing, implementing specific measures, and following exact standards by RBI. This all helps the overall economy improve and move towards the betterment of the global financial market. * RBI at times reduces the base rate to maintain it at a reasonable and decent position. This base rate affects the overall lending process enormously, so the central bank becomes more cautious about conducting a smooth lending process across all banks. Market fluctuations affect the base rate as RBI alters and works on it regularly. * When the monotony increases in the market globally, the SLR rate is also slashed at times. Many banks operate very lazily during a specific period in a year. They do not initiate any new programmes or develop new ideas to boost the economy. They need to make financial or process improvements. When SLR rates are slashed, it gives all banks equal opportunity to improve their function and initiate new programmes. Even the staff in the branches work more dedicatedly to enhance and manage the operations of their departments. * These rates are even slashed so that banks can work with higher authorities, and any institution must not interfere in their work. ## **Penalties for failing to maintain the SLR** All banks must maintain the SLR. Every fortnight(Friday), banks have to report their latest net demand and time liabilities. It is mandatory for all banks in the country to maintain the SLR as it helps boost the economy and expand credit. If any financial institution fails to maintain the SLR, the RBI charges them a 3% penalty annually on top of the bank rate. If they fail to retain it the next working day, a 5% penalty is charged. This ensures that banks do not fall behind in keeping cash when customers need it. ## **Reason for imposing statutory liquidity ratio** An astonishing direct financial instrument has helped the Indian government sell its obligation instruments and protections to banks every now and then. You will wonder how the SLR helps upgrade the economy and it has advanced and elevated the obligation of the board program of the public authority. The programme is intended to assist in saving money by offering top of the line loans to all areas of the country. The primary justification for laying the SLR by the RBI is to be more cautious. In any monetary action, it is vital to be mindful and watchful. Any bank in the country works with a chief rule to gather deposits from general society and afterwards assurance to offer clients with funds at standard or more. Be that as it may, this is a highly hazardous movement for each bank. To safeguard each bank's risk and lessen its risk rate, the RBI makes it mandatory that each bank conveys a portion of its funds with the RBI so that its funds are protected in possession of the most responsible entity as the safest assets. ## **Conclusion** In a nutshell, the statutory liquidity ratio is crucial to boosting the overall economy in the global market. This rate is slashed or increased by the RBI only, and banks do not have any control over it. The banks need to maintain these rates to work with complete transparency. All commercial banks are obligated to retain this rate in the form of liquid assets such as gold, bonds, cash and many more for the customer's benefit. SLR is mandatory for each bank to maintain credit and fuel growth in the economy. The government also helps control inflation by reducing the statutory rate and increasing it during a recession. The RBI reserves SLR deposits and banks do not have control over it. Failing to maintain the SLR rate can result in penalty charges annually to the bank, and repeated failure can result in many more consequences. RBI gives all banks and their staff equal opportunities to initiate new programmes and work towards the smooth operations of their respective branches. For many banks who operate lethargically during a specific period, the RBI pumps them to work in a better way by reducing SLR rates. Therefore, SLR is for the benefit of the financial and economic growth of the country, and every bank must abide by its rules. ## **FAQs related to Statutory Liquidity Ratio** ### Why is the statutory liquidity ratio required?

While Initial Public Offerings have been a significant trend in the market for the past year, there is still a limited understanding. IPO is a process undertaken by a company to raise funds for its business to grow further. Once these IPOs enter the market, they are traded on the stock exchange in India. IPOs fundamentally change the structure of any organisation as it transitions from being private to publicly owned, thus influencing all significant decisions ahead. IPOs are an excellent opportunity for investors to become parts of companies with immense potential value. If you seek short-term profits and immediate gratification, you may choose to sell your IPO as soon as it starts trading in the market if it has made a splash upon opening. In contrast, if you genuinely believe in a company's potential, you may hold on to your investment so that as the company\u2019s value grows over time, so does your stock. Do you believe that a company will show promising growth immediately upon entering the market? Then applying for an IPO might be the right option. Do you think the company may have a sluggish start but is a worthy option in the long run? IPOs may be your solution. ## What is a New Fund Offering? One can easily get confused between IPOs and NFOs. An easy way to distinguish them is that while Private companies introduce iPOs, NFOs stand for New Fund Offerings issued by Asset Management Companies to launch new schemes. These NFOs are essentially the launch of new mutual fund schemes, and the money gathered through the NFO is used to buy securities like bonds and equity. Once the initial issue is completed, investors can opt to purchase fund units at the current Net Asset Value (NAV). Moreover, people who opted for the NFOs enjoy promising gains upon the mutual fund being listed in the market. ## How do IPOs and NFOs function? IPOs and NFOs have a few key differences that dictate how they function. The purpose of each investment option is different. Companies usually opt for IPOs to get the funds to grow further. AMCs launch an NFO to provide a new mutual fund investment option. It raises funds needed to acquire securities and launch the mutual fund into the market. ## Difference Between IPOs and NFOs Diving deeper into the dissimilarities between IPOs and NFOs can help you understand what might be the wiser investment option for you. While both allow you to make investments at the inception stage, their immediate and long-term impact, crucial factors, and probability of returns differ. Here is a quick guide to help you differentiate between the two. ### Understanding Terminologies Such as Mutual Fund Units and NFO Periods While this may not directly impact your investments, it is crucial to know the terminologies used in NFOs and IPOs. A single unit of an IPO is popularly known as a share. The number of shares you get determines a mix of the multiples set by the company and each share\u2019s price. The single unit in your mutual fund is called a fund unit. You can decide on the number of fund units to apply for, and they shall all be invested purely in the assets considered best suited by the fund house. Similarly, an NFO period is the number of days available to apply for an NFO. This usually differs between equity and debt funds. ### Risk Assessment With IPOs, the actual value of your investment will be determined once it enters the market. Once exposed to the stock market, you have no control over how your stocks will be valued. Therefore, you need to study the company\u2019s history, the eagerness in the market for the shares, and the expected behaviour of the stock. With NFOs, you will not know the exact assets your funds will be allocated to or have a performance history of that particular mutual fund. Therefore, it will become critical for you to understand the fund house\u2019s reputation, the fund\u2019s objective, and the theme that this particular NFO may be targeting. ### Initial Offering IPOs, even though not in the market yet, can only be applied for through established stock exchanges. This ensures fairness in the allocation and distribution and connects to the rest of your stock portfolio. NFOs are available for the public on the fund houses\u2019 websites and can be applied directly. ### Pricing The price of the IPO is determined by the issuing company itself, depending on the attractiveness of the valuation and the organisation\u2019s fundamentals. NFOs are usually priced at a face value of INR 10. Therefore, IPO prices are dictated by the issuing company itself, whereas NFOs are generally kept at the same price, irrespective of the fund house involved. ### Listing Price Upon the completion of the IPO period, the price of the shares at which they will be listed and traded on the stock market will be determined by the assessment of other traders and the perception of the company\u2019s promise. When it comes to NFOs, the Net Asset Value of the scheme is dictated by the value of the securities currently present in the portfolio. ## NFO vs IPO: Which Is the Better Investment Option? Your goals and the market conditions decide the better investment. When it comes to immediate returns, an IPO might be wiser if there is immense excitement in the market and it has already been oversubscribed many times over. NFOs often provide promising returns, but it depends on the assets present in the mutual fund scheme at the end of the day. So, if you see tremendous excitement over an IPO, you might want to look at the buzz and understand if it is all conjecture or if there is real potential. Similarly, if you wish to stay invested in a company in the long run, a slight dip at the beginning will not affect the long-term growth of your chosen stock. NFOs are an excellent option for you if you wish to invest in mutual funds but want a cheaper option than the ones in the market. The returns on your investments will be uncertain, and you must understand the risks involved and the fund\u2019s objectives. NFOs may also come with lock-in periods, while stocks can be traded on the market. ## Things to Keep in Mind Before Investing in IPOs ### The Company\u2019s Business Model and Focus Before you invest in an IPO, have a clear understanding of the company\u2019s business model and its revenue generation strategy. This is the essential information and will provide you with knowledge of the company\u2019s stability, its liquidity situation, and position in the industry. ### Market Share and Growth Metrics In a market growing as aggressively as India, it is important to identify companies that offer a strong growth trajectory ahead. It would also be helpful to subscribe to IPOs that value the company issue richly. ### Volume of Application IPOs are considered a reliable investment option and have gained immense popularity. Oversubscriptions are bound to happen in such a case, reflecting the eagerness for the shares and the probability of you securing an allotment. ## Things to Consider Before Investing in NFOs ### History of the Fund House Before investing in an NFO, you must check the history and reputation of the fund house launching it. Develop an understanding of the fund house\u2019s past performance in numerous markets, specifically in comparison to its peers. Above all, it adheres to the scheme\u2019s mandate and follows prudent investment processes. ### Fund Objectives NFOs are launched alongside necessary paperwork such as the Scheme Information Document (SID), product presentation, etc. These papers explain the fund\u2019s goals, planned assets to be allocated, and investment strategy. These documents will help you understand the investment process and how the fund managers will handle the invested amount. Remember, the mutual fund\u2019s goals must align with yours for truly fruitful returns. ### Cost of Investment While most NFOs do not have additional entry charges, you may be charged an additional amount if you wish to withdraw your investment. Make sure you are well aware of such exit load fees and their application period before investing. You may also be charged an expense ratio on your investments. Ensure that the fund of your choice has a lower expense ratio, thus providing you with higher returns. ## What are Mutual Funds Units? ## What is the NFO Period in Mutual Funds? ## IPO or NFO: Which Way Will You Go?

With a host of exciting IPOs and NFOs on the horizon, get your research hats on, start analysing, and make those strategic investment moves soon! The market awaits. ## FAQs ### What Is an IPO in the Share Market? An IPO helps companies transition from being privately owned to publicly owned entities and helps them raise funds and grow further. An IPO offers you the opportunity to make an initial bid for the shares before the company enters the market. ### What are NFOs? A New Fund Offer (NFO) is a first-time subscription offered for a new scheme launched by an Asset Management Company (AMC). The money raised through an NFO helps AMCs invest in the securities they require for this new scheme. ### What Is the difference between an IPO and an NFO? An IPO allows you to own shares of a company before it enters the market. Once launched, the stock price is subject to fluctuations in the market. An NFO allows you to begin investing in a mutual fund without paying the current mutual fund rates. However, there is limited knowledge of the kind of assets your chosen NFO will invest in.

The debt market comprises several financial instruments that enable the borrowing and lending of funds for interest. However, since debt is safer than other asset classes, it also offers lower returns. Nonetheless, it is an ideal investment option for risk-averse individuals. ### What are debt funds? Debt funds are a suitable investment for those with a low appetite for risk. Here, investors put money in securities that generate a fixed income. The interest rate and the maturity period are pre-decided by the issuer, thus the name \u2018fixed-income securities\u2019. Examples of such funds are treasury bills, corporate bonds, commercial papers, and much more. ## How do debt funds work? Debt funds mostly work based on credit ratings. Fund managers use this factor to filter out a variety of low-quality debt securities. Higher-rated debt securities imply that the issuer is less likely to default. However, this does not mean that low-quality ones are not worthwhile. A few fund managers, with a larger risk appetite, might account for the higher returns on low-quality debt instruments and invest in them. The interest rates also influence the fund manager\u2019s decision \u2013 they invest in long-term securities when interest rates are falling and short-term securities when interest rates are rising. ## Who should invest in debt funds? Debt funds are diversified across multiple securities, so returns are stable and within the expected range. Therefore, these funds are ideal for those with a low-risk tolerance. However, they can also work for investors looking for a short-term or medium-term holding for excess cash. Moreover, debt fund returns are better than bank deposit returns. ## Types of debt funds Debt funds can be categorised based on their maturity periods. They are as follows: ### Liquid fund It invests in securities that generally mature in 91 days and is an ideal short-term investment. ### Dynamic bond fund It is dynamic because it invests in securities with different maturity dates. It is meant for those with medium risk tolerance and an investment window of three to five years. ### Money market fund It invests in securities that mature within a year and is suitable for those looking for safe debt securities in the short term. ### Gilt fund It invests only in government-issued securities and carries a low credit risk. Thus, it is great for those with a low-risk appetite. ### Banking and PSU fund 80% of the assets are invested in debt securities of public sector undertakings (PSUs) and banks and these are meant for risk-averse investors. ### Corporate bond fund 80% percent of the assets in this fund are invested in corporate bonds. Such a fund is ideal for investors with low-risk tolerance and those who are interested in high-quality corporate bonds. ### Floater fund 65% of its investible corpus goes into floating rate instruments. Such funds help mitigate the risk of market volatility. There are several other types of debt funds like the overnight fund, ultra-short duration fund, low duration fund, medium duration fund, and much more.Moreover, their maturities range from one day to four years. ## Things to remember before investing in debt funds ### Risk factor Although they are among the safest securities, they carry a credit risk (of the issuer defaulting) and interest rate risk (price drop due to an increase in interest rate). ### No guaranteed returns Debt fund returns**** are not guaranteed. Moreover, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a debt fund can fall with an increase in interest rates. ### Associated costs There is an expense ratio included in the investment amount. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandates that this percentage be 2.25% or less of the overall asset. ### Varying investment horizons If you want a short-term investment, you may choose to put money in liquid funds. However, if you have a longer horizon, then you may invest in dynamic bond funds and earn better returns. ### Taxable Capital gains from both short-term debt funds and long-term debt funds are taxable. ## How are debt funds taxed? Before investing, it is important to understand the debt fund taxation. All the dividends received from these funds are taxed in a classical manner since Budget 2020. The tax rate depends on the holding period. If it is shorter than three years, then the returns are called short-term capital gains (STCG) and are taxed as per the income tax slab of the investor. On the other hand, long-term capital gains (LTCG) occur when the holding period is longer than three years and are taxed at 20% after indexation. ## How to invest in debt mutual funds? Today, there are several third-party platforms online through which you can start to invest directly in debt mutual funds.

Chapter VI A of the act lists down the various deductions that help you enjoy tax benefits. These deductions are available by putting money in different types of financial instruments. Such investments reduce your taxable income and help you to save money by decreasing the tax liability. ## What is section 80CCC? Section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides tax deductions when you invest in certain types of pension funds, which include the following. * Annuity plans offered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) * Other plans offered by various insurers as specified under section 10(23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 The deductions are available when you buy a new insurance plan or renew an existing policy. ## Why is it important? Generally, private sector employees do not get pensions after retiring and need to plan their finances for the post-retirement years from their income. One of the available options for financial planning is to invest in pension funds. Generally, such plans have longer investment tenure and allow you to accumulate a sizeable corpus over the years. In addition to ensuring financial independence after your retirement, the annual contribution to the pension plans is eligible for tax benefits under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The tax saved can be invested further to build a huge retirement corpus. ## Features of 80CCC * You must invest in a pension plan from a fund as per the guidelines of section 10 (23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. * The investment amount should be paid only from your taxable income and the deduction cannot exceed total taxable income. * Any proceeds like pension, interest, or bonus earned from such investments are not tax-exempt. These are added to your income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. * Any lump sum received at the time of surrender of the plan (in whole or part) is also taxable as per the applicable income tax slab. ## Eligibility to claim deductions under section 80CCC Not every taxpayer is eligible for 80CCC deductions. Here are the eligibility criteria. * Only individual Indian as well as Non-Resident Indian (NRI) taxpayers can claim the deductions. * Deductions are not available to Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), partnership firms, companies, associations, and other non-individual taxpayers. * You should be earning a taxable income that is adjustable against the deductions under this section; if your annual income is less than the minimum exemption limit, there is no need for you to claim these deductions. * The tax benefits are available only if you invest in specified pension funds during the financial year. * The investment should be made from your taxable income and not from any other source of income. ## Terms and conditions of section 80CCC To ensure you claim the deductions under this section, you must note the terms and conditions mentioned below: * You should not surrender the plan either in whole or part, if you do so, the surrender value is added to your income and taxed at the applicable rates. * The investment must be in pension plans that pay annuity on maturity. * You should put money in the specified pension funds during the financial year in which you are claiming the deductions. * The pension plan should be brought from an Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)-approved insurance company. * Rebates on any investments in annuity plans before April 1, 2006, are not eligible for benefits under section 88 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. * Deductions are not allowed for any amount deposited before April 1, 2006. * If you make an investment in an eligible annuity plan as a single contribution, deductions under this section are available only for that particular financial year. ## How can you claim deductions under section 80CCC? You may claim the deductions as per 80CCC limits while filing your income tax returns (ITRs). To avail of the benefits, you have to report the total amount invested in the ITR; however, the maximum deduction is capped at INR 1.50 lakhs per annum. You must remember that the benefits are available only on the amount you invest in a particular financial year. Any accrued income like bonus or interest is not tax-exempt and will be added to your income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. ## Difference between sections 80C and 80CCC The primary difference between 80C and 80CCC is that under the former section, you can invest in eligible financial instruments from any income and claim the benefits even if the investment source is not taxable. On the other hand, to get the benefits of the latter section, you need to invest in eligible pension funds only from your taxable income. Section 80C provides tax benefits on contributions made in life insurance premium, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), Employee Provident Fund (EPF), tax-saving fixed deposits (FDs), Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY), Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs), infrastructure bonds, principal repayment of home loans, and much more. In comparison, section 80CCC benefits are limited to investments in eligible annuity plans from IRDAI-approved insurers. Any interest, bonus, or pension received from such policies is taxable. Moreover, the amount received on surrender is also not exempt from taxes. ## Understanding section 10 (23AAB) Section 10 (23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is linked to the benefits available under 80CCC income tax limits. Clause 23AAB includes the income of a fund set up by the LIC or other insurance companies on or after August 1, 1996. You should have made contributions to the policy or fund of these entities with the primary objective of earning pensions in the future. The accumulated funds when paid to you as a policyholder are added to your income and taxed at your income tax slab rate. Moreover, these are not taxable for the insurance company. The Income Tax Act, 1961 offers various sections to provide tax deductions. Now that you know the eligibility criteria and terms and conditions of section 80CCC, you may invest in eligible annuity plans offered by IRDAI-approved insurers and enjoy the tax benefits. ## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) ### What is a pension fund under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961?

Luckily, if you overpay your taxes, you are eligible for an income tax refund. When that money hits your bank account, it is an exhilarating feeling. You can choose to invest it or use it to fund one of your life goals or points on your bucket list! This guide explains everything there is to know about the ITR refund and how to check its status online. Let's start by understanding who is allowed to claim the refund. ## ****When Am I Eligible For an Income Tax Refund?**** Income taxpayers are typically eligible for a refund when the tax paid by them exceeds the tax liability. Tax refunds are typically paid after the end of the financial year. For individual taxpayers, it can take between two weeks to four months. One way to expedite your refund is to file your taxes early. ## ****How Is My Income Tax Refund Calculated?**** The first step to calculating your online refund status is accurately figuring out your tax liability. Take the following factors into consideration: * You have paid more tax in advance on the basis of self-assessment than the tax payable on the basis of regular assessment. * The TDS paid on your salary, securities, dividends and other sources of income is higher than the tax payable on the basis of regular assessment. * Your income is already taxed in a foreign country with which the Government of India has an agreement to avoid double-taxation. * Your investments come with tax benefits and deductions, which you have not declared. If your gross tax liability on the total taxable income is less than your net tax liability, the extra amount will be refunded to your account. ## ****How Will My Income Tax Refund Be Processed?**** * The first step is to file your returns online every year before the deadline. The earlier you file, the better because your income tax refund can be expedited. * Once you have filed your returns, your income tax returns must be verified electronically via an Aadhaar number OTP or EVC generated through your registered bank account. Your tax returns can also be physically verified. In this case, you must submit a signed ITR-V (acknowledgement) to the Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) within 120 days of filing the return. * The CPC located in Bengaluru processes your income tax returns. If the taxes paid are higher than the liability, an income tax refund order is generated. * Finally, the refund order is transferred to the ITR banker, which then credits the refund to your registered bank account. ## ****How Will I Receive My Tax Refund?**** An income tax refund can be paid in two ways. One way is paying it via an account payee cheque drawn in favour of the taxpayer. Alternatively, it can be directly credited to your bank account that was added while filing your returns. Make sure that you add your bank details correctly. ## ****How Can I Check My Income Tax Refund Status?**** ### Check Online ITR Refund Status Via E-Filing Portal If you have registered on the e-filing website, you can follow these steps to check your income tax refund status. 1. Visit the . 2. Click on the 'Login' button in the top right corner of the website. 1. Enter your user ID. If your Aadhaar is linked to your PAN card, you can input the Aadhaar number. If not, enter your PAN. 1. Click on 'e-File' on the top menu bar and select 'Income Tax Return'. Then click on 'View Filed Return'. 1. You will then see the statuses of all the returns you have filed. ### Check Online ITR Refund Status Via NSDL Portal One of the quickest ways to check your ITR refund status is through the NSDL Portal. 1. Click , and you will immediately arrive on the refund status page. 2. Enter your PAN Number, assessment year and the captcha code on the page. 3. Press 'Proceed'. 4\\. You will be taken to a page that displays your NSDL refund status. ## ****What Are the Types of Income Tax Refund Status?**** * **Not Determined:** Your online ITR refund is still being processed. Revisit this page in a few days to see if the status changes. * **Refund Paid:** This means either a cheque has been dispatched or the refund has been credited to your bank account. * **Refund Failed:** The IT Department could not process your refund because your bank account details are incorrect or incomplete. You must request a refund re-issue and ensure the details are filled out properly. * **Refund Expired:** Failure to encash your cheque within 90 days will result in your refund expiring. If you see this message, you must request the IT department to issue another cheque. * **The Cheque Has Been Encashed:** This means your cheque has been cashed. Check to see if the amount reflects in your bank account. * **Refund Returned:** If you fail to receive the cheque, it is sent back to the IT Department. If you see this status, you need to request a refund re-issue via the income tax portal. * **Refund Adjusted Against Last Year\u2019s Outstanding Demand:** You will see this status if your refund is adjusted against any previous outstanding tax demand. The IT department sends an intimation for such an adjustment, which you must respond to within 30 days. If you don't respond, the department will proceed as per their suggestions. ## ****Can I Earn Interest on Refund of Income Tax?**** Yes, absolutely. If you paid excess tax in advance, your refund will be granted with interest. Under section 244A, you are eligible for interest as follows: * If the refund is 10% or more of your taxes, you qualify for an interest rate of 0.5% per month or part of a month. * The interest is calculated from April 1st of the assessment year, i.e., the year after the financial year, until the date your refund is granted. ## ****FAQs**** **Q. What are the various forms in which taxes are paid?** The forms of taxes include TDS, self-assessment tax payments, advance tax payments, and foreign tax credits. **Q. How is my refund calculated?** You must file your tax returns by declaring income earned during the financial year, investments made, deductions claimed, and taxes already paid. When the tax paid is more than the tax payable, you will get a refund. **Q. Is it important for me to know the refund amount?** Yes, it is extremely important to know the refund amount. Sometimes, there could be a calculation error by the department. If that is the case, knowing the amount will help you request a refund re-issue. **Q. Why must I verify my returns?** Without verification, the Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) will not process your ITR, and consequently, your refund. **Q. How long does it take to get an income tax refund?** If you are a salaried person, your refund may be credited within two weeks, especially if you have filed your returns early on. On average, the estimated time span for the ITR is between one and four months. For businesses, the return can take between 3 to 6 months to be processed. ****Q. If my income tax refund is not processed, what do I do? If your ITR is not processed, you must create a refund request for failed requests. You can log into the income tax filing website, click on \"Services\" and then \"Refund Re-issue\". If it indicates that there is no failed request, you can visit the grievances section and file a request there.
